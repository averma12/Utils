Looks like it took quite a while to start, but I think it might have started now. Let's see. Okay, we're on. Great. Sorry about that. Okay. Jono has mysteriously morphed into Nate and Yaku. I don't exactly know how that happened, but hello, Nate. Hello, Yaku. Thanks for being here. Happy to be here. I want to say hi, Yaku, so your face appears. Hey everyone. Yaku is actually in Queensland, but not actually in front of that particular island display. Where's your island display from today, Yaku? It's constantly changing, I know. This particular island display is up in the Whitsundays. That's actually where they filmed Pirates of the Caribbean. Definitely recommend. checking it out if you come to Australia. Yeah going sailing in the Whitsundays is one of the best experiences of my life I've got to admit. Moving on from sailing in the Whitsundays, a quick logistics notice just you should click stop Solvert in your dashboard and reconnect to make sure you've got the current version because we had a quick little fix to some new functionality we'll show today which is the duplicate button which you'll find there on your server. Today, we are going to start by not using SolveIt, but by instead using something that Nate released this week after giving us all at Answer.ai the great joy of being able to use it for the last few weeks. And it's literally a life-changing experience for me. So without further ado, Nate, tell us what you built and how it connects to all this Solve It bizzle? Yeah, so I created Shell Sage, which is a bit of a mouthful. The code name at Answer.ai is Bash Buddy, which is a lot easier and friendlier. But Shell Sage is an AI assistant right in your terminal. and the really great thing about having a ai assistant right in your terminal is that through the power of tmux it can actually see what you're seeing and this gives it the same sort of context awareness that you see when using SolveIt. So, for example, in SolveIt, when you're writing to the AI assistant, it can see all of your messages above, whether or not that's the code and the output of the code or any notes that you've written to yourself or previous messages from the AI assistant. And so it can give you context-specific information. answers that you wouldn't be able to get if you were, say, copying and pasting your code and stuff into, say, ChatGPT or copying and pasting outputs from a terminal into ChatGPT. And I think what happened is, like a lot of us at AnswerAI now, when we use an archaic system which is not connected like directly seeing what we're working on and connected with an AI, it feels hopelessly obsolete. And so, you know, when we were working in bash on our server, for example, it felt ridiculous to have to do things myself or have to tell an AI what I'm doing and what happened. And so you've basically bought all that to, to the terminal and, oh dear, somebody in the chat, uh, Justin Hong might have to be banned for bad punning. Just like humans, shells age. He put the space in before that. That is just terrible. So, dear. So why don't you, what are you going to give us a demo so we can see it live? Great. I also want to make a quick shout out to to Richard Rees in the Discord. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Actually, I'm going to be going through this one shortly. So he's going to get a big shout out. OK, great. Yeah. OK, great. Yes. So if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, which is great. And we're actually going to do the first step anyways on a new server. So let me go ahead and swap over to that. So I've been teaching the AnswerAI Team System Administration in recent weeks. And we've actually been using Shell Sage as part of that. So everybody now has their own little server that they have launched, a nice fresh server that we used OpenStack to launch automatically from the command line. So I guess this is your fresh new server, Nate. Yes. And it's called Sadmin because I always have issues when it comes to system administration, but Shell Sage is turning that around. So this is a very bare bones installation of Ubuntu 2024. and the only real sort of package that i've added to it is conda so that i can install shellfish this service costing you six dollars a month i believe so yeah we went for the extra two gigabytes of ram we're big ballers here at answer um and so one thing that's really nice with shell sage is you can also use it to bootstrap so if you don't have tmux or anything installed you can also get shell sage to help you out with getting all of that set up. So I can do pip install shell sage to get the most recent version. And we're basically in business. I can type s sage to invoke shell sage. And since I don't have tmux installed, if I were to try and ask it a question, it will first generate an error, which will be fixed in a future version very soon. But if I don't want that, I just have to do dash dash nh, which stands for no history. Basically, don't use tmux. And just a question from the audience here about what kind of computer is this we're logging into. This is from a company called Genesis Hosting. Genesis Hosting, like a lot of folks, uses an open standard called OpenStack, which is really nice. So by using an OpenStack provider, we're able to basically use the same scripts and processes across all the providers we want. Yeah, think about it as like AWS's CLI or GCPs, but actually it's Fain. And open. And open, yes. So let's go ahead and see how to install Tmux. So Tmux is, you're going to be telling us more about it for now, though suffice to say it's something that SalesAge needs in order to provide the context understanding of what you've typed recently and what answers you've got back recently. Yeah. And as you can see, it gives me a few options. So I know that I'm on a Debian slash Ubuntu server, so I'm going to use the apt install version. And then it says I can launch tmux by just invoking the command afterwards. And also I can use a man tmux to get some information about what tmux is. So we'll go ahead and do that. There's no history as in you're saying I don't have tmux installed. So we'll probably remove the need for that pretty soon. It'll check for itself where the tmux is there and maybe give you a warning. Yeah. Isaac gave a really cool way of doing that. So we'll be pushing a new version shortly. All right, so I installed that. I'll go ahead and just open up Tmux's man pages by typing the other command that Shell Sage provided. And so here is basically the actual documentation behind Tmux. It stands for a terminal multiplexer, and it just basically enables creating sessions and managing different types of, like shell environments in a single window in a really clean and easy way. And it's very popular among system administrators. And so we can go ahead and read through this documentation, but we have Shell Sage, so we can use Shell Sage to help us out here. Let's go ahead and launch TMUX. As you can see, some stuff just changed a little bit. I now am in like a fresh new environment. I also have this bar at the bottom that's green that has some information on it. And in the bottom here, you have information about the session you were in. You don't really have to worry about it. We at Answer just usually use one session. And then within that session, we'll use some other stuff like windows or panes, which I'll show you shortly, to have different working areas. And so now let's go ahead and ask Shel Sage, how do I use, to give you a bit of a understanding of how TMux sort of works. Oh, my goodness. Oh, I just... Shell Sage likely knows me a little bit too well. I will just mention something, though, about chatting to language models, which is because they are autoregressive, they've learnt by completing sentences. This might seem surprising, but actually they work better if you type grammatically correctly, use correct capitalization, you know, that kind of thing. The reinforcement learning phase we talked about last time does help them to answer correctly, even when you say, who do TMUX? But, you know, it's actually worth spending time. We could, you know, it'd be probably, maybe we should add a little grammar and capitalization fixer or something to solve it at some point, but we don't currently have that. So it is definitely worth spending time trying to type things carefully to get better answers. Yes, I totally agree. Luckily, Shell Sage was able to understand me in this instance. So it gives me a little bit of information on what are the main things do with tmux as you can see there's this control b which is kind of like entering command mode in tmux and then you have some next sort of key press that will trigger an event for example if i want to create a new window i can do control b c and now i've created a new working space session, or window in this case, where I can run commands that is separate from the one that I was just in. So let's try to focus here on the bit that I reckon everybody ought to know, which I reckon you don't need to know this, I would hit Ctrl D to close this one, and to go back to the original one. And then I would show focus on the split panes, because that's what like, I think everybody probably wants to know how to do. And then with Ctrl B, Z, that is going to really get people uh optimizing their their team the workflows makes sense yeah so um one of the best things if you want to make all of your non-tech friends think you're a hacker is to split your pain into multiple different session into different uh into different pains so control b will uh with uh with the double quotes, we'll do it horizontally. And then with the percent sign, we'll do a vertical split. And then to navigate around, I can use Control-B and then the arrow key. So if I want to go back to the main one, I can Control-B up. And now I am in the top one. And all of these are separate, so they don't conflict with each other or anything like that. So can you show Control-B-Z in that one so that I can maximize that pane? Yeah, so Control-P-Z basically zooms into a particular pane to make it full screen. And now this is super useful if you've done a lot of outputs and you want to zoom into a particular one to focus on doing some specific task. And then if you want to go back to the multi-pane view, you just do Control-B-Z again, and you're back into the multi-pane example here. So the only other ones I would show you perhaps before we jump into Shell Sage would be Control-B-D and Tmux-A because Control-B-D is very nice because it means that you can reboot your computer, go away, come back tomorrow and come back to exactly where you left it, including Jupyter server running, long running training jobs, et cetera. Yeah, so if any of y'all have suffered from SSHing into a server, running something, and then your SSH connection drops or something like that, and you realize that your long-running training job was killed because of it, TMUX is something that you should definitely look into because of this ability to detach and have sessions always going on. So if I do this Control-B-D, I have detached from the tmux session. And now I'm back into my original terminal shell environment before I launched the tmux command. So you can see all of the history is still here and even the commands that I ran. And if I do something like tmux ls, you can see the existing sessions that are currently available in the tmux server. So I have this session 0 that has one window. And if I want to reattach back to it, I would just type in tmux a. And that gets me back into whatever state that I was running in. Any long running commands that I was running here would still be going on without interruption, which is super useful. And a quick question from the chat about Authenticating. So you do need an API key from anthropic for this, we will be adding other LM providers as well. But for now, you need to set the anthropic API key environment variable, which if it's not currently mentioned in the Readme, we will make sure it's added to it. Yes. All right, let's use it. Awesome. Okay, so I have a problem with my server. Shall we Let's do it. Control-B-Z. And so I have a problem with this server. I have unfortunately put in a lot of data, and so my space is getting limited. So I need to get Shell Sage to kind of find out where in my file system I have my largest files so that I can clean them up. So let's go ahead and ask Shell Sage. And this is a place that also voice can work pretty well. Yes, something like transcription with WhisperFlow. We can showcase that in a second as well. But here we can see that Shell Sage has recommended using the sudo du command with a dash ah flag. And it's piping it through a bunch of stuff. But it also gives us exclamation points. explainer for each one of these. So in this case, it's running it with elevated privileges because it's trying to do it on the root, which you can do. But in this case, it's going to probably take a little bit too long for this demo. So we'll change that in a second. And then it's using this du command. So this stands for disk usage. And it's just formatting it for us a little bit. And then it'll pipe that and sort it by the top files and folder usages. So let's go ahead and run this. It actually even gives a quicker result, one for my home directory, which is actually what I want. It even gives me a little warning here that it might take a large time on large systems. Great. Thank you very much, Shell Sage. Okay. It looks like the problem seems to be in my data. Don't tell us. Have it tell us. Okay. All right. Let's see. So let me do it with some voice. Great. I ran the commands. Now what? So it sees the output as well as the history of input. That's the really cool thing about Shell Sage. Yeah. So as you can see, analyzing the output, it's able to tell that Oh, interesting. It hasn't actually used the output very well. Yeah, and it is able to navigate, investigate specific directories. So it does know that it is in home Ubuntu data. But I would have said my request would have been more specific than yours, I would have said something like, Oh, what do you see in this output, or something like this, I think it's quite useful to try and Again, like try and be the human in the driving seat, not just for SolveIt, but also for Shell Sage. I find it works better if I really try to drive towards the answer I'm looking for. Yeah, I agree. Do you think we should give it a little bit more hints or should we? Yeah, why don't you say like, you know, what do you see in these results or something like that? Great. OK, now this is way more specific. I like it. It even gives me the numbers. So it's saying that there seems to be a lot of large video files that are taking up the space, along with some image files. And it even recommends some actions. Oh, also repository with a large Miniconda installation that I probably should clean up. I can investigate further for this particular directory that seems to be taking up the most space. But let's go ahead and give it a little bit more information on what exactly I want to clean up. Just before you do, I'm going to answer a question from the chat, if that's OK. So Thomas asks, if you type in your pseudo password, will it be passed to the LLM? Now the answer is no, but I want to explain why it's no. Solve it. And Shell Sage work exactly the same way, which is that the thing that's passed to the LLM, the information that's passed to the LLM, is the information you see on your screen. So in SolveIt, everything above the current message is sent as you see it, along with context, if you've added that. And here, everything in Tmux is sent. So, Nate, can you just do a control B left square bracket? So control B left square bracket puts you in scroll mode. And then if you press page up a couple of times, You use PageUp? Oh, PageUp. You don't have that on your keyboard? There's PageUp on my keyboard. Should be function up, otherwise. Well, how do you survive without PageUp? There you go. OK. So as you can see, Tmux has been keeping track of all the input and output. And so that's exactly what will be sent. So you won't see the pseudo password there. And so if you don't see it there, Claude's not going to see it either. Um, okay, so let's give it a little bit more of a challenge and let's say that I want to clean up all of the files that are above, um, 300 megabytes. Okay. I want to clean up all of the files in the data directory that are above 300 megabytes. How do I do that? Look good. Great. Awesome. It's interesting to see because my recommendation would be to look at them first. I'd be interested to see if Shell Sage makes that recommendation as well. Because if you've got like, you know, grandma's 95th birthday, do not delete.mp4. You probably want to know that. Yeah, there you go. It is. So. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And also it is moving them. Yeah. Yeah. And so I can also do it with RM and what's even greater is that it uses the proper, you should be using dash I so that you have to confirm whether or not you want those files actually deleted. And it breaks down each one of the bits. So I can also list the files here and make sure that this command is actually gonna do what I want it to do. That one looks good. And I'm going to go ahead and delete these because I know that these are not grandma's old home video footages, luckily. And I'm going to go ahead and say, or I'll go ahead and confirm with Shell Sage, does this look right to you? Of course, they won't really know if those are videos you want to keep, but maybe at all. That's true. Let's see what it'll say. And yeah, asked me to consider the different options. So that's great. Yes, I've considered them. Thank you very much. It really wants me to back them up. Its recommendation to gzip them is actually terrible, which is interesting. So remember, these things are not always great. Gziping a MP4 won't make it any smaller at all. Oh, interesting. Good call out. And as you can see with the dash i flag, I have to confirm. I wonder why. I feel like yeah I think piping into uh rm minus i might not work okay again we've got some minor issues but anyway I think that's enough probably to get started right yeah is there anything else you wanted to talk about shell sage before we Move on. Just check out the repo if you have any cool ideas. Also chat about it in the Discord. I've been loving the energy and stuff like that that people have been sharing their experiences and feature requests and stuff like that. I know everyone wants to be able to use other models, so that is a top priority to get in. And feel free to also contribute as well. PRs are welcome. And probably the kind of amount of energy required to get started contributing to ShellSAGE would be way lower than almost any other project you've come across because Nate's designed it in a really clever way. So it's very concise, so it's very easy to work with and understand and it's also early days so it's very small. Also at Answer.ai we tend to value lower complexity more importantly than we value, you know, A lot of the kind of enterprise style software development so it's like much easier to read and work with so yeah anybody who's interested in like contributing to open source, for the first time. This is probably a good opportunity to do so, and you can do it, you know you can use solve it or notebooks or collab or you know stuff like that to try and do it in a more. solve it friendly way practice what you've been learning. Yeah, and also Nate's very helpful and patient. So if you're not sure how to do those things, and there's also the community on the Solve-It channel that's on the Solve, sorry, the Shell Sage channel on the Solve-It server. He can help you. Yeah, I guess one other shout out is that there was a change, and so I'll be hosting the office hours after the class today. With Yaku, I think. Okay, thank you, Nate. I will leave you to keep an eye on admin stuff that's happening. Thank you for joining us today. Great pleasure. Everyone see you on the discord. Okay. And then Yaku. Hello. I think we're now going to move to another non solvent thing, which is a specific kind of application area of the Solve-It style approach, which at Answer AI, we've been using a lot over recent months and it came up with you during an office hours you were running. So maybe, yeah, tell us about, you know, this idea, I guess you helped out somebody with, with something they asked about. But afterwards I kind of said to you, oh, maybe we should focus actually on teaching people how they can learn themselves. Yeah. So what came up during the office hours was that one of the students was looking to learn about generators. And he sort of said that he'd read the docs. Hang on, decorators, right? Say again? Decorators, not generators? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant to say. So Freudian slip if that came out wrong. So yes, decorators. And yeah, he was having trouble understanding it. And he just asked if we could go through that. And so we did do a little bit of a solvent explanation, but yeah, as Jeremy said, we probably could have done a better demonstration of how to do that yourself. So that's what we're gonna do today. All right, let's do it. All right. So what I wanna learn something from Solve It. We're going to assume that we have very limited knowledge today. We're quite new to even Python itself. And we want to learn about decorators. So we're learning something new and quite early. So I'm just going to start off with a prompt. So you're a typer as well, Yaku, or do you use voice input sometimes? I've started using the voice input, but currently Alfred and... Here, I'll show you. See, it's conflicting with the Super Whisper. I need to fix that still. So I'm trying to learn about decorators. I've read the docs, but I just don't get it. So kind of treating this like it's Jeremy and I have my own personal Jeremy and I can ask him questions. I don't have to just watch the videos anymore. I can now actually ask him questions. So, hey, I'm trying to learn about, I read the docs, but I just don't get it. Can you show me some examples? So I wouldn't start there. Let's talk about how best to get the most out of this. Luckily, it's helping you a bit. When you're getting help here, it does help to understand some basic ideas about how best to learn and how best to do education to help solve it, help you. Rather than jumping into examples, you can see here it's asking us some questions. I would start out by saying like, I don't know what, what do you mean functions that take other functions and what that, what's that got to do with decorators or something? Because actually we need to start out by understanding. So I would have started out by saying like, hey, what, what's the basic idea? Can you give me an overview? Okay. Or we can change it. No, don't change it. Let's keep going. Let's go. This is great. We can just cancel. And I would answer question two and say, yeah. Okay. Yeah I get functions. Okay so again like let's try to be careful about how we type these things because the better we type the better the kind of better the autoregressive mode is going to get in. So let's say you know use capitalization, say yes, add a comma. It makes a really big difference to the responses we're going to get. Okay. Comma I am comfortable with Python functions. And that's another good reason to get voice working is it tends to give you better constructed sentences. Yep. So let's start by understanding functions as an argument. This is a key part of decorators. OK. Function can be treated like any other object. So you can assign them to variables. Here's a simple example to try. Would you like me to show you a basic example of passing a function as an argument? Would you prefer to try writing yourself? Yeah, I would say, I don't know how to do it. Can you show me? Sure. You just say yes then. And you can press command enter to submit or control enter. Okay. Um, so here's a simple example. So we've defined a function, say hello. And we've defined something called apply greeting, which takes a function and a name, and then it's going to call that function with the name. So when we have apply greeting, and then we're going to use it by putting in the say hello function and passing it Alice as the name. Okay, so let's try it. So let me just explain how that works to people. So it's like it's not very straightforward. Yeah, go ahead and submit it. I like the way you use the copy up to code there. So in the apply greeting function, the way to think of it is that where it says func in def apply greeting func, that func is going to be replaced with whatever you send it. So we're sending it say hello. So instead of saying func, it will be say hello. And name will be replaced with Alice. So it's going to actually return the result of calling sayHello Alice. And this is literally what functions do. In fact, math is basically replacing symbols with other symbols according to rules, as is computer science. And so when you kind of do it that way, you can work through it in your head to see exactly what's going on. I guess we should ask what on earth this has got to do with decorators, should we? Sure. So decorate is a special way to use this concept. It's a function that takes another function and returns a modified version. So let's build on this example. So here's the same idea written as a decorator. So we've got this at greeting decorator function. And then there's another def inside of it. So I haven't seen that before. It's kind of interesting. It's a def inside of a def. So I'll ask about that in a second. And then let's put this at on top of get name, which we didn't have a get name before. So it seems like it's a slightly different example. Yeah. So maybe we should start then by looking at the, it's just a shorter way of writing colon. So maybe let's copy the bottom line that it's got the ad greeting decors. Yeah. So if you copy that by going to the far right and clicking on the copy button and then press Apple V and then we should try it. Because that's what we do. But we haven't defined this stuff yet. That's true. So prompt. Yes, no worries. So let's click on the previous one to modify it. I can delete it. That's fine. Yeah, OK, you're right. So let's do it a different way. So let's delete the previous one. Get rid of it. OK. delete it. And instead we can modify it. So yes, click delete. And this is actually a useful thing to show people how this actually works. It doesn't want to delete. So let's change. So scroll up so that we can see that. Yeah. Click on the copy this to output button here. Yeah. And we'll see what it actually does is it copies in all of the bits, all of the code, which is quite cool. And so if we just delete the ad greeting decorator and the print, then Get rid of that get name, get rid of the print, everything except get rid of the get name. There we go. That's what we want. Get name is not defined. Oh, it's get name we wanted, not add greeting decorator that we wanted. Yeah. So we'll copy this. But not with the decorator. There we go. Sorry about that, Jaco. That's all right. Oh, so now we should try it. Oh, what the hell? Yeah, we've come out, got this in a bit of a broken state, haven't we? Yeah, oops. Okay, back to this. Nice. Okay, so yeah, now we've got name is Alice, yeah. Okay. And then... We actually wanted the get name equals at greeting decorator. Oh, it's a bit annoying because it's giving it the same name as what we started with. So what if you selected it and made the def called underscore get name, you know, and then get name equals get. Yeah, so we want the whole thing. We just want to do it without the decorator to start with. Okay, I modified to do it without the decorator. So to do it without the decorator. So you delete that. Yeah. And then you use change get name to underscore get name. And then copy their last line of code, which says get name equals at greeting decorator into your output. And then change that. last get name to underscore get name. Yep. Yeah. So it's kind of like, yeah, trying to get this to actually demonstrate it. It went too many steps ahead. Um, so this is where we kind of got to be a bit careful about that. I guess the educational approach of these things, they, they often jumped too many steps ahead. So now you should be able to call get name. And we put in a name that we want. So we add Alice. And, okay, so it came back as hello Alice. And our underscore get name returns name. Okay. And then get name returned a function. AddGradingDecorator returned a function. Yes. Returned this new function wrapper that we defined that where wrapper takes in name and then is returning this is an f string so it's going to execute inside of it. So personally what I would do at this point if I didn't fully understand it was be like, Hey, can you break this down line by line? That's happening. Okay. So, I mean, the goal of this isn't to learn about decorators. It's just to kind of walk through the pros and cons of the approach. I think this is useful, right? So we can see, like, in order to learn stuff with SolveIt, we have to be quite intentional. And, you know, you really want to, like, try every example. And anytime there's an example you don't understand, you've got to, like, asking, you know, and keep going into smaller and smaller pieces. And if it tries to go too far ahead, you've got to try to rewind and kind of go through it more, you know, more slowly. So I think something that would be really useful in the office hours, you know, is if there's ideas, you know, libraries, APIs, computer science techniques, anything else that you've had trouble learning, you know, bring them to the office hours or a study group. and work through them, you know, and say like, here's me trying to learn about it. Here's me trying to ask the question. And in the office hours, we might try to really focus on, you know, teaching people how to fish rather than doing the fishing for them, if that makes sense. There's a question in the chat about like, should you delete portions of the conversation if it goes too far off track? I'd say yes, definitely you should, right? If the dialogue's not going in a direction you're happy with, because of the way the language model's trained, it will want to continue to go on in a direction that's not very good. Because in the past, documents it's been trained on, things that tended to go badly, keep going badly. So instead, modify one of its outputs to say what you would wish it had said. you know, or just delete everything from the point at which you kind of felt like it wasn't going great and try again. It's really important to understand how these language models are trained in order to get the most out of them. What do you think, Yaku? Um, yep. I think, well, I guess we've kind of shown the concepts here of learning. Did you want to keep going or...? No, no, I'm just, yeah. to get your comments or your thoughts on the process basically. So yeah I guess let's see how we go after. So after class today there'll be another office hours and maybe folks can join in and you guys can try this out. Nate will be there too right? Yeah yeah for sure he will be there and yeah we can try that then. Okay super. I've got some more examples of this kind of thing I can show if people are interested. And for these examples I'm going to show a new tool which I really like. And the tool I want to show is something in Claude called projects. So projects Here's an example. Projects have a few things in them. One is just you can add a system prompt. So when I was kind of experimenting with teaching kids calculus, I just added a system prompt. So that's kind of the most basic starting point. And then you can see, you know, doing calculus. And one nice thing in Claude is that it can output artifacts, which are fun. And so we kind of used that to kind of ask for examples. And I was trying to help the kids kind of get a sense for the basic ideas behind calculus. The more interesting part, however, is that you can add context. Now Discord, I was creating a Discord helper which would let me right click on something in Discord and choose get message link. it would basically create a bookmark of that message that I could look up and jump to later. I had never used Discord API before so I basically grabbed all of the documentation that I thought might be necessary and turned them into markdown files. So let's just have a quick look example of that. Often it's quite difficult to kind of scrape documentation. Often it uses JavaScript. It often has like, like Google's ones have some kind of bot detection. I don't know why you'd do that because it's really good to have bots using it. But a really good way to do this is if you right click on docs, choose inspect. And then if you press left arrow until you can see basically the entire area that you want is selected like so. And then you can just say copy out of HTML. And then I created this thing called web2md.answer.ai that you can paste that into. And underneath, you can see it's turned into Markdown. And then what I normally do is I then click on gist it. Right, and we now have a gist that contains that documentation. We should have given it a markdown name so it would actually appear as markdown. There we go. And then what I do is I then add that to my Claude project. And so you can see there they all are, right? And so with this, and then I added a system prompt, say like help me create a Discord app and then I would just kind of ask it basic questions like I would like to create an application in Python for Discord in which I could right click on a message in a server and it would send a link to that message to a DM to me so that I could effectively bookmark it for later. Based on the documentation provided, does this sound like something that should be possible using this approach? So don't be too concise. Tell it everything you want. Give it all the information you need. And this is kind of where I started. The other thing I forgot to do here, because I started doing this back before this was an issue, is I would go back to this here and I would say don't use artifacts, because they're not at all useful for Python. Save instructions. Just while we're on this screen, Jeremy, could you show quickly where the gist was useful there? where the gist was useful. Actually, I guess in this case, what was important was the, well, yeah, I can show you. You could actually just paste it in. So maybe in this case, the gist wasn't necessary. You could just copy. So let's go back to the project, Discord. Yeah, so when you say add knowledge, you can either upload or add text. So yeah, you actually want to either save the file locally or paste it. So I guess actually in this case, the gist wasn't so useful. Yeah, thanks for checking. So now that we've modified that to say please don't use the totally pointless artifacts, which it's really overenthusiastic about, it should give us something much more. prosaic. So you can see. Where was that? Sorry. Now I've lost where I was doing it. Anyway, so I used that to create that Discord thing and also to kind of document it as I went. And a similar idea, Richard created a nice tutorial here for Shell Sage using the same approach, I believe, which is adding the context to a project being the kind of existing documentation that they created. And one thing that's really helpful is that in these cases, Richard exported a gist of the Claude project output. Unfortunately, there isn't something built into Claude currently to do that. But my colleague and friend, Hamel, has kindly made one. So you can go to Claude Save and get an extension that will save it in exactly this format, as you see. So let me give you some tips for kind of how to create good documentation and other things you can do with this. So one thing I did was I wanted to create documentation about a library I created called Fastlight. And so I tried to make sure I asked very specific questions to be like the kinds of things that I really wanted people to know the answers to. So what does Fastlight add to SQLite Utils? you know, okay, show an example of doing this, show an example of doing this. And I'm not really getting it to just write the documentation for me. I'm trying to get it to write the things that I want to kind of add to my documentation. So again, it's like pretty much a dialogue between the human and the computer, even though I'm not in Solve It here. This is one of my favorite ones. Actually, sorry, not this one. This one's one of my favorite ones. One of the best books I've read for many years is this book by the guy that created HTMX and some other folks. And it's basically all about how to create web applications from a deep understanding of the fundamentals of how the web works. And I think it's amazing. And I wanted to be able to provide parts of that to both have something that humans can read, but particularly I wanted something much more concise that a language model can read. So I think I've got something strange here. So let me just do it here. OK. So I don't have the original dialog I used to create this, which is silly of me. I should have kept it. But I can show you how I made it. all of the first chapter of the book into context. And then I basically said like, please summarize this for me. And its first summary was crappy. And I basically kept telling it how to make it better. I'd be like, provide a lot more information, provide a lot more examples, copy things than the original. And I went through about five goes until I got one I liked. I modified it myself, editing a few things I didn't like. I then deleted everything between. And so I ended up with me asking a question and it giving it a great answer. And then for chapter two, I then put chapter two plus the chapter one summary in and said, please create a summary of chapter two using the approach you see of the summary in chapter one. Here are some things particularly to look out for. So I summarized the things that got wrong last time. And the second time I only had to do it like twice to get a really good answer. And you can see like for a whole chapter, it's got, an extraordinary amount of detail and examples, but it's much more concise than the book, right? So it's a really great reference. So again, I deleted the ones that I didn't like as much. And so I added up with something where the answer was exactly what I would have liked, edited it to make it even better. And then for chapter three, I then did the same thing. And then I again added the extra things that were still not quite getting right. And for chapter three, the first time it was perfect, right? And it's got all these great examples. details and then so I just kept adding one chapter at a time and after a couple more goes it then did a bad one again and so this time I actually kept the bad one and I said and I and I left it in the dialogue and said no no no not like that you know look at the earlier chapters to see how to do it right here are the problems and so then chapter five again is great you know it's got all this detail and so I found I can add now this markdown of a chapter to a dialogue and immediately the language model fully understands how to use HTML and HTMX really well. Let's try to see how I get the URL on the screen. Not quite sure how to do that. Sorry. Just trying to get the URL on the screen as well, but it's a bit tricky. I can see it now. Okay, great. I'm just cutting off the very bottom, but hopefully you don't need the very bottom. So let me show another interesting example of this, which is something quite different, which is there's a lot of stuff out there for creating meeting notes. And to me, a meeting shouldn't happen unless it's going to create some really useful output. So for me, we don't have meetings at Answer AI very often at all. And when we do, we have a really high bar for what they're proposed to do. And then so since they're meant to be really good, really useful things, then we want the artifacts from that to be really great. So the normal meeting notes you get from AI tend to be super concise and not really tell you what went on. So when I had a meeting with Hamill, I pasted the whole thing into a cloud project that I use for this purpose, right? So it's like, here's my Zoom meeting. I just paste it in the full transcript. And I said to it, this is key. I said, right, rewrite this to be suitable for publishing in a magazine, right? Combine their contributions so it's less fragmented, clean it up, right? Do not lose any content. This is the most important thing. Just do the first eight paragraphs. And then stop. And so then here's the entire... Oopsie-daisy. Here's the... So I've got a brand new keyboard, which was possibly a mistake to use this because it's a really strange layout. Okay. So here's the whole transcript. And then it's like, okay, here's a rewrite. And it always does, you know, a pretty bad job. So I edited it. So I did a couple more versions of that and said, no, no, that wasn't right. That wasn't right. And then I kept, you know, the one that I did like. And then I said, great, go on. Okay. And each time I remind it, right, what I want it to do, you know, or you can just kind of keep the dialogue going. And again, it's like, yes, you know, more reminders about the things I want to make sure it gets better and better at, you know. And I just keep going small bits at a time. And it ends up with a super nice shareable artifact that I shared with my team. And people really appreciated it. People were like, wow, that was such an interesting thing to got a lot of information out of this. Yeah, so it's probably a bit different, right? I mean, it probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to do rather than like zero minutes. But for sharing something that's meant to be a really high quality artifact from a really important process of like, you know, multiple people are going to be reading or watching this thing, I think it's really worth doing. Another example was I wanted to teach people how to use FastHTML, like what's the purpose of them. So I included a lot of the hypermedia book I just showed you, the summary of it in the project. And also the FastHTML, some of the docs. And so I'm being really very quite focused here on what I'm trying to get out of it. And hoping to kind of think about the kinds of things that people often misunderstand. Like, what the hell is actually a hypermedia application? So that's another example of trying to do the kind of FAQ based on things I'm actually getting asked on the Discord to get the kind of answers that I want. So I find that useful. I also did the same approach because FastHTML is based on Starlet. I wanted a really good manual for Starlet. People understand the architecture of a fast HTML application. Again, I'm just providing it. And the nice thing about this approach is that each time I build these, I can use more and more of them in the context for the language model. And so they just keep getting better and better. And that's kind of what we're looking for, right? If you let the language model drive a process, they're generally going to get worse and worse because of kind of the limitations of these kind of autoregressive approaches. But when you're doing this kind of approach, each dialogue you create is better than the last one. Each prompt response was better than the last one, you know? So again here, like what are the components of fast HTML? How do they work together? And you know, again, I'm kind of showing examples that I want them to show me how to do it. And so I tend to kind of, sometimes I provide these gists directly as links from the docs. Sometimes I'll go in and edit the gist, right? And so then this is really important because then when I use this as an input context for another Claude project, right? I can tell Claude like, oh, look out for the notes from me where I've pointed out places that previously a model misunderstood it. Here's another one. And it's also for humans, you know, humans, humans that read these things and computers are going to be pretty similar. So Jeremy, if you wanted to summarize another book, would you maybe, and it was like web related, would you then maybe start by taking a section of your HTMX thing that you've done or the whole thing and putting that in first? Yeah, if I'm looking for something similar where it's kind of quite a technical book with examples, I would probably say like I'm looking to convert this chapter and include all the examples just like I did with this chapter with those examples. Absolutely. So as you know, Yaku, and I assume this is why you're asking this question, this is called in context learning in AI. And it basically means giving examples of desired outputs for inputs. Language models work dramatically better, like way, way better when it's in context learning. The problem is most people don't know how to do that because it's not particularly clear what the examples should be. If I had examples, I wouldn't be asking the question. So here we're building up a library of examples. And again, the kind of the idea here is we're trying to get in this really positive reinforcement loop where every time we use AI, we get better at it and the model gets better at it, exactly. Great. Okay. So maybe we'll have a five minute break before we jump into Advent of Code. And when I come back, I will also check the chat to see if anybody has any questions. Sound good, Jaakko? Sounds good to me. Okay. Thank you, sir. All right, I'm back. Are you back, Yaku? I am now, yep. We're all back. I was busy reading the Zoom comments. Excellent. Sorry, the YouTube comments. Actually, I'm not quite organized as it turns out. I think I'm organized. All right, are we ready for some Advent of Code? And what are we doing? Day three, right? Day three. Okay, so hopefully you've all had a try at this already. So let's remind ourselves as to what we're doing. And I think you're sharing, Jeremy. Okay, I should probably do that then. Oh, and I know the shortcut need the URL anymore. Okay. Oh, a question in the chat. Robert's asking how I change the answers of the AI. Well nowadays, now that Solveit exists, I would just do it in Solveit. So back then we had some different proof of concept approaches I had to use instead. But nowadays, yeah, SolveItDirectly lets you change the answers of the AI. So that's what I would do. All right. The gondola lift isn't working. Engine part's missing. You have to add up all the part numbers. Should be easy to work out which part's missing. There's a visual representation of the engine, lots of numbers and symbols. Any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a part number. So we're getting our notation. Okay, so there's a part number. Periods are not symbols. Okay. Great. copy that, and we've got a new feature called duplicate, thanks to Jono. So to do, to use that I've now created a little advent of code template, which actually I guess I could also add a little bit of help to here by saying input equals get data actually before I do that we should run all, so I get some help for autocomplete. Get data, okay, year equals 2023, and day equals three. Great. And really matter what the day is because we're going to be just using this as a template. So then I'm just going to go duplicate. Then I'll click on it. And edit the title here to AOC Day 3. Maybe worth leaving the day empty in your template so you don't accidentally forget to change it. I've been caught with that once or twice with you using the wrong days input. That's a really good idea. Okay. AOC day three, part one. Okay. Okay. Import. Column 50 say. Okay, so that's our sample. C code. Okay. Okay, sample. Okay, there we go. Okay. So what I've noticed is often people seem to find the parsing bit the hardest. I think with the solver approach the parsing bit for me is always the easiest. And the trick is just to go into smaller and smaller pieces for the parsing. make the smallest bit work and then gradually build back up again. Now in this case, the goal here is we need to find all of the numbers which have a symbol next to them. So I kind of like to think about what an ideal data structure for that would look like. And I guess rather than this current one, Now what I really want to know is where are the numbers and where are the symbols? Where are the numbers to know if it's next to a symbol? I need to know where the number starts and where it ends. Now I happen to know how to do that, but let's assume we don't. So we can ask. What is a concise and easy way in Python to find all of the places where a string of digits starts and stops inside a larger string? It's not always easy to explain exactly what you want. You'll notice often, as is the case here, I misspoke and re-spoke, and generally these modern voice-to-text things tend to do a perfectly good job of figuring out You don't have to worry about it too much. Okay, ari.findita. So something that Nate added recently, which is really nice, is that any time that you in your prompt or note or the assistant in its response has a function in backticks, it provides a hyperlink to it. So a key, key, key thing. is any time that something comes up that you didn't previously know about in Shell Sage or Solvert or Claude or whatever, is stop and go learn about it, right? And that's why this has been made as convenient as possible. Okay, so here is find iter. I'm just going to turn my Discord off because it keeps beeping. There we go. find iter return an iterator yielding match objects over all non-overlapping matches oh that sounds interesting non-overlapping for re pattern and string now the thing about documentation like this is it's super concise because it uses bits of jargon as a shorthand right which is a perfectly fine thing to do as long as you always look up the jargon and the jargon is generally in good documentation like python is going to be a hyperlink An iterator, what the hell is that? An object representing a stream of data. Each time you call next, you get different successive items in the stream. Again, it's a bit of an infinite tree of jargon, but over time you'll learn these ideas, these core ideas, and you'll be able to read them more quickly. What the hell is a match object? A match object. OK, well, basically, the key thing to know about an object is what can it do. So you read through it. It's got an expand. It's got a group. A group can take zero or more group IDs. And then the key thing is the examples. So I would read all that. But for now, I guess the key thing we want to know is basically, how does it work? and basically how does it work is what's the signature of it. So if you just pop a question mark there, okay, then you find out. Okay, it's find, iter, pattern, string, flags, and a quick summary. Okay. Okay, regular expressions. I know regular expressions, so I am Because I know regular expressions. Regular expressions are amazing. They have a very, very unfair reputation as being difficult. And I think the reason for that is that they are a concise notation, you know, like math. example. And things with a concise notation cannot be read at all like math by somebody that doesn't know the notation. It just looks mysterious, right? But just like to a Chinese speaker, Chinese is not hard to read, English is. To an English speaker, you know, Chinese is hard to read. An unfamiliar notation will be unfamiliar until you learn it. But that doesn't mean it's hard to Regular expressions makes things easier, much easier. And there's a small subset of regular expressions that I will teach you so that you will know enough to be this person. But yeah, don't let it bother you that they look strange. Basically, a regular expression is something that allows you to search through a string to find substrings that match a pattern. And so we're going to describe what some of those things are. Let's first of all create a joined version of the sample, just a smaller version. I'm just going to go sample.replace And replace a new line with nothing at all. And we'll start playing with it. Okay. So a regular expression takes a pattern. What's a pattern? It's a string. So just to make this a little bit less typing for me, I will go from re import findIDA. Okay. So I can now just type findIDA. And the first thing I need is a pattern, right? So here's a really simple pattern. Four. What does four find? Four finds a four. That's actually, let's do a seven just to make it more interesting. Okay, where do I find it in? Inside my string ss. And findIDA returns an iterator. So basically you'll get this kind of thing a lot in Python when it says iterator. Basically what that means is that you get something that you could then loop through later to get all the answers from it. To do that all in one go, I can simply do this. Now that's a lot of work. So let's not do that. Let's instead say define findItter. And this is basically a way, a totally standard way, you can always wrap a function and get it to do something else. If you say star args star star keyword args, that basically says pass through everything that you get sent off to something else. We just say return list re.findItter. Because I want this to work for me, I want it to work the way I want it to work. And I always want to be able to see the list. So modify your environment to make it work the way you want. So now that we've done that, we can get rid of list. Great. Just little things. slightly easy, easier to deal with. Okay, so what's it done? Well, it's looked for all the places that the pattern matches in the string. The pattern is 7, so it's told me that it's found it's matched to 7 at 2 comma 3. Okay, now immediately we've seen something that a lot of people on the Discord messed up, which is span is the start and the end, but be careful because look, 0, 1, 2, this is 2, that is the start, the end is past the end, right? So be very careful. It starts at 2 and 3 is just past the end. Which is like, it's not bad, right? Because the difference between the two is 1 and this is of length 1, that's fine, right? But just be careful. So you can see that by studying our data as we go, it really helps, right? So we found all the sevens. Do you think they do that so you can slice it nicely? Fits with the slice notation? Yeah, exactly. Ranges work this way. Pretty much everything in Python works this way. Yep. I think that's a great point, Jakko. So no complaints about it, but certainly an easy mistake to make. But again, we read the docs and then we tried it. And then we looked at the answer. And so we've got everything we can now. And so being in too much of a hurry with Advent of Code to win the speed race can be a bit of a mistake. Because what we actually want you to do is maximize the learning race here, which is another good reason to do the 2023 version. Because at this point, you're not going to get on the leaderboard. OK. Now being able to find the sevens is somewhat useful, but not super useful. Let's find the digits. So here's where what I would do is I'd press command shift up arrow and that creates a new cell with the same as the last cell. And I'm going to show you the first thing to learn about. I'm just going to show you a really minimal set of things which will get you a really long way. The first thing I want to show you is that you can type in a set of things to look for. And a set is always in square brackets. So I want to find anything in that set. All right, so there they all are. So that's found four, six, seven, one, one, four. Okay, I'm gonna close that up. Don't quite need all that on my screen at once. That's enough to know, right? But obviously that's a little bit annoying to type all that. So it might be useful to know that you can instead use a hyphen to say everything between 0 and 9. You can also do a to z, and there's the same thing. And now we're at the point where it's like, you don't need to learn, this is called a character class, right? So this is a character class, it's all, everything in this set. For what it's worth, some character classes are used enough that people have even shorter shortcuts for them. So identical to this is backslash D. Backslash D means a digit. You never need to use it. You can always use square bracket naught to nine. It's slightly less typing to write backslash D. There is, however, a bit of a problem, which is we need to put an R in front of it, and I'll show you why. If I write print, backslash n, for example, as you might know, that's not actually a backslash followed by n. That's actually a newline character. So in Python, to say I actually made a backslash, you can write an r at the front, and that means everything in this string, a backslash means a backslash. It means don't turn them into anything fancy. R, you can think of it as R for regular expressions, because this is where you use them all the time. So basically, anytime you're using a regular expression, it's not a bad idea to get into the habit of typing R apostrophe or R double quotes all the time. Okay, great. So we've learned about character classes, and I said that we're going to try to stick to the minimal necessary bit. So then the second main thing to know about in, um, regular expressions is that after a character class, which could, this is a character class, this contains number seven, it's a set of possible things. This contains the set of those things. After that, you can then, um, add, uh, a second character to say, how many times do you want that to appear? By default, you want it to appear once. So there's a single four, a single six, a single seven. Okay. Um, If I want one or more times, plus. Plus means the previous character plus one or more times, which is actually what we want, right? So if we submit that, then I think we can agree that's looking pretty good. 4, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 35. You see? And they're not overlapping. So there's all the places that we want. So Dr. Mikko on the chat says he quite likes writing regexes, but finds them hard to read. And they're hard to read in the same way that math is hard to read, which is two possible reasons. One is you don't know some of the symbols. And the second is you try to read it too fast. So the only way to read a regular expression is to go through every single piece bit by bit. Now one way that can make that a lot easier is to go to somewhere like regex101.com and paste in your test string without the quotes and in your regular expression and say this is a Python regular expression and notice here how it says oh I'm always going to put an R in front of it by default so that's nice and you can see exactly what's going on right zero to nine match the single character present in the list zero through nine okay followed by single character, plus matches the previous token, one to infinity times, and then here you can see all the matches. Okay, so this is a a good way to, you know, check your understanding, but also as you can see solve it's also a good way to check your understanding. So let's try that then. This is looking pretty good. Let's try it in Samp. Again, this is why you, you know, want to do this stuff carefully. Make sure it all works and like, oh look at that. That worked too. So we don't really need that SS thing. So I'll just delete that. Is the ss closer to what the real one is going to look like to me? Oh no, they have the backslash n's in there, don't they? Yeah, they have the backslash n's and we actually care about what line it's on. Yeah, that's right, sorry. So, we actually need to know something. This is not quite the right answer. Like, you could turn this into the right answer, to be honest, because each line is some particular length. So, It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's 10 long. So if we did this integer divided by 10, it tells you what row it's on. And if you did this mod 10, it would tell you what column it's on. But why use math when you don't need to? I'm not a huge fan of that idea. So instead, we're going to try and do it a bit smarter, a bit simpler. And I'm going to just go back, so I've got a somewhere around a neat little, yeah this, I'm just going to steal this. I'll show you this in a moment because it comes up quite a lot. So I always like to be able to visualize things easily. I should probably put this actually in my template because it comes up so much. But here's a command called show. And it's going to go through each row in some matrix. When I say matrix, it's just a list of strings. And it's going to print it out along with some numbers. And I'll just show you what that looks like. So if I say show samp. Oh, what did I do wrong? Ah. So first of all, exactly, so before I would do that I would always say lines equals samp dot split lines. And very often I like to run, I've modified something up here, I want to modify, run everything below. So don't forget we have a run below button, so that runs all my messages below. And obviously this then needs to be lines. Okay, so I think that's a bit easier, right? Because now I can immediately kind of see the coordinates of everything. And so I can kind of more easily now check whether I'm getting back the coordinates I want. So 4, 6, 7, I want to see something saying, oh, it starts at 0, 0 and ends at 0, 3, just one past the end, or 0, 2, depending on how we do it. Maybe we want 0, 2. And then like 35 starts at 2 comma 2 and ends at 2, 3 or 4, so forth. So the row it's on is actually pretty straightforward. That's just going to be the row number as I loop through each one. And the column, we know how to get that for the start and the end, we can get from find . So that feels reasonably straightforward, right? We can So when the lines represent a matrix, I often like just to call it m, because there's nothing particularly special about them being lines, right? So perhaps you folks remember from last time, we've seen that you can go for i comma o in enumerate, and that just, oh yeah, and you always need parentheses in my list comprehension. Okay. So there's my row numbers. It's kind of quite nice, along with each one. And so then for each one we want findItter. And we want to find the digits. So let's grab that. And we could even say, like, digitsRe is this. Okay. And then we'll just go copy and paste. And rather than O, we will say, well, we've got our new special find data, which listifies it for us, which is rather nice. And so first of all, we pass in the pattern. And then we pass the thing to search through. So here we go. 0 has two things, 4, 6, 7, and 1, 1, 4. Nice. 1 has nothing. 2 has two things. 4. Yeah, it looks pretty good. 9 has two things. That looks pretty nice, right? So what I like to do now then is to think about like, OK, well, be the nicest possible way to have this? It's basically like, oh I want a little object which has the row number and the start and stop column, and also what digit it is, right? So something I find really useful for this is to be able to like instantly create any object I want. And there's a nice little thing in Python called simple namespace. And I use it so much I tend to give it a different name. I tend to call it NS. And so basically you can create it like this. You just start creating a little object. There's my little object. So I want to create something for parts. They said a part is a string of digits. So as usual, I would call it underscore part. And it's going to take two things. It's going to take the y that it's on, which is here, okay, and it's going to take the match object, which I'll call mo. And so we're going to return, okay, and what are we going to return? We need the span So let's just come back to that. So let's grab one of these, right? Let's grab, if we grab this, give this a name. Sorry, not that. Yeah, grab this. Which one do we really want? We just want one match object to play with. So how about we just grab this and we'll call this matchObjects. And so that way it's going to be easy to play with one, right? So matchObject equals matchObjects zero. MatchObject. Okay, great. So this is where you can just save a bit of time. How do I grab the starting point, the ending point, and the matched string converted to an integer for a single match? mo.start, mo.end, and mo.group. So return, okay, a namespace containing, so our starting x I'll call x1 equals mo.start, our end2 we'll call mo.end, I think I want the start and the end to be semantically the same, so I'm going to subtract one from it because that's actually where it ends. And then we've got the y, of course, which we can just pop here, and then the digit equals int mo.group. Okay, so Now that we've done that, of course, we should immediately test it. So underscore part, and we're going to be passing in y. So for the first part that's 0, and the match object is mo. And there we go. How's that looking, Yaku? It's looking pretty good. I guess one question I had, Jeremy, it's just with the namespace. Maybe you said that while I was out. Do you just prefer that over like a data class because of more concise writing? Or is there another reason you like that one? Sure. So Yaku's asking about this approach here called a data class, which we could absolutely do, which is where you add a decorator. since we've been seeing decorators. And so this is going to be something, it doesn't just take a function and return a function, it can also take a class and return a class. And so we could create a capital P part. And we could say x1 which is an int. And x2 is also an int. Oops, you did the wrong button. And y is also an int. And our digit is also an int. And that's totally fine as well. Sorry, what did I do wrong there? Oh, x1 colon int. Don't mind me. just don't know Python. Okay, and so then you can do the same kind of thing. Now one nice thing about data classes is that as long as you stick to the same order, you define them, you don't have to say all the equals. So if I go x1, x2, yd, I can say x1, sorry, yeah, x1, x2, yd. That's totally fine too. Yeah, you know, for me, I don't know. This is an extra step. I don't like extra steps. This was less steps because I still need to write underscore part, you know, but I'm fine with either. They're both nice that they print out. One nice thing about data class is it prints out the type of thing or else this one has no type. It's just a namespace. All right. So, what we now want to do is we want to get, for every row, we want to get every part. So, I would be inclined then to say, like, I've got some particular row, m, 0, and let's do things in really, really small steps. Okay, so there's my first row. There was a question, Jeremy, where you've got underscore part, and then you've got a zero and an MO. They're wondering why zero? Yeah, because this is what we're going to be going through, right? We're going to be going through all the rows. And so on each row, we're going to have the row number and all the matches. So that's where we get our Y from. Yeah. So in this example, we're just looking at the first row, and that's what the zero is. Exactly. So this match here was on the first row. index 0, yep. Cool, so we basically could now just grab this, right, put that in a function maybe, so we'll copy and paste. We've already got that re defined, so let's just say def row matches Okay, so we're going to be going through the row. And actually, you know, I'm making a mistake here, aren't I, because I'm trying to do it in too many steps, so let's get rid of the def for now and actually do it for real. What I'm going to be doing then is that's my, you know, that's my row matches. Oh, and I guess digre was 0 to 9 plus. Oh, so it's actually, we're not looping through anything. we're just doing, ah yes, actually what we want to do, oh we don't even need a numerate. Okay, so that's actually pretty straightforward. So it's good that we're doing this in small steps. So we want find iter, that's our row matches, in our row. And so now we want to create parts from that. So if we now loop through each one of those. And so we'll call that row parts actually. We loop through each one of those. Okay, so here they all are. Okay. And we're going to want to call underscore part. And remember underscore part. the match object and the y. So these are both in the first row, and the match object is going to be something that's coming out of this. Now, so they're the two things, so that's good. So something interesting about this is that we're just calling a function on everything in some list. So what I'd be inclined to do then is to change our definition of part. So it's always nice to have the thing that varies come second, and you'll see y in a tick. So we're gonna get lots of matches per y. So let's put the y second. Check that still works. does. And what that means we can do is say, come a second, is we can say l findEta So create a, oopsie-daisy, create a part. Don't know how that happened. Create a part for every match object, right? Now each of those parts needs to know what the y is, so we can then say y equals zero. So either is fine, but I'm just showing you this way to say there's a kind of a way of just getting a bit more into the flow of these things by recognizing that basically you're just list processing, you know, and you can just like, oh, I'm just mapping a function, I'm just mapping a function. Neither is necessarily better or worse. So this is row matches. And it's for, it's quite nice to see, like, what do we need exactly? We need a row and we need a y, okay? So, y, comma, row. And so we can just check that works. Row matches, zero, comma, row. Probably a good idea to return it. Okay, so this might look familiar, zero row. What's row? Remember, that's our row. And so actually then, we can now do this. Think about this, right? We go L, our matrix, right? So that's all of the rows of our matrix. Dot enumerate. So there's all the rows of our matrix with the line number followed by the line. And those are the two things that I want to pass into row matches. Now I've got to be a bit careful here, because probably I want to say dot map. But, Jaco, do you see why that's not going to work? Because row matches wants to take two things. Two things, exactly. And it's going to be sent one thing. It's a tuple. Yeah. Yeah. Tuple's just like a list, but we're going to be learning a lot more about tuples in future lessons. It's a very important data structure. So we want to basically destructure that tuple to send the two things separately. And there's a thing in the standard library in Python called star map, which does map, but does exactly that. It destructures it. And so L has that as well. So L tries to have all the kinds of useful bits with the standard library in it as well. Okay. So we seem to have found 10 parts here. Or not quite. What have we found? We found not 10 parts. Here's a list for the first row. Here's a list for the second row. Here's a list for the third row. So we need to concatenate all those lists together. Yeah. So this is quite often when you do this more functional approach, you often find yourself just clicking on the previous one and adding a little bit to it. And now we seem to have found 10 parts. So I reckon we should double check that. Would dot sum work on that last one as well, Jeremy? Yes. No. Kind of. Yes, I think so. Summing lists should work. Oh dear. What are you doing to us, Yaku? And the reason that works is quite nice. It's because sum just means apply plus. And in Python, applying plus to lists concatenates them. But that was awful. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nice. We found them. So like I said, that wasn't fast, right? But it's not clever. We didn't have to keep anything in our head because we're just doing a little bit at a time. And so now that we've got that, we need the same thing for star. And I'm rather inclined then just to say like, well, okay, this is a part. And like, I like to reuse stuff. So why don't we create a star? And that's going to return, now stars are always one long, so that goes to return an x. And it's not an integer anymore. That should always be a star, but let's change as little as possible. And then We then called so that's how star okay, and then we called row matches We probably should have called that Let's change it now. You know when you like that's that was a mistake. This is a thing that creates parts Parts Because if you kind of later on realize your notation wasn't ideal and you don't change it, then you'll be like, oh no, now everything's all, you know, confused and my brain's messed up, especially if your brain's a bit small and slow like mine is, right? Yeah, parts, that's much better, right? Because now we can say stars. Now, a star does not actually mean a literal star in a regular expression. Star is a lot like plus. It's something that says how many of the previous token do you want? But we say no, we actually want a star. So remember, backslash is something that you can add to something that would normally be a special character class and make it not special. Actually, we don't just want stars, do we? We actually want, is that right? Yeah, well, there's a sign as well. Okay, so we shouldn't call them stars. We should call them symbols. Yeah. Symbols. And so I think the Advent of Code question defines them not by what they are, but by what they're not, which is actually great. already learnt this for a set. And so you might remember in math there's something called the complement of a set. The complement of a set is everything not in that set. So they were defined as being anything that is not a digit and not a full stop. And so let's use our shorthand. Instead of writing square brackets 0 to 9, we're like, oh no, we could just do that. So the complement of a set is caret. So this now means everything not in this set. out everything that's not in the set would be too hard, so let's just write it as not the complement of the set, not zero to nine, and not a full stop. Do you need a backslash on the full stop? You do not, because it's inside square brackets. Okay. But, you know, absolutely no harm, so you don't have to know. Full stop is a special character class, meaning anything at all. regular expression, which is why Yaku wanted us to be a bit careful of how we dealt with that. Okay, so then we're going to look for all of the sims. That won't quite work yet, because we don't have sim. That's fine, we'll just let it be wrong. We'll go back here, change that to sim, and then run all below. Okay, and not a great row to be testing on. So let's do, let's do row 8, because it's got two things on it. Row equals m8, never assume you get anything right, always write it immediately afterwards, otherwise the one time you don't, it'll be broken. Okay, so we found our symbols, right, so like don't spend time thinking, just use what you've done. So we don't want parts anymore, we want symbols. And so we've got our symbols, that's good. And so then we just did this, right? So copy, paste, star map, sims. Okay. So now we could say def. We want to return two things. Let's do them separately. I guess we'll be a bit lazy about this. It's always good. Copy, paste. So symbols. Okay. And parts. I always like to line things up so I can see more clearly I sort of messed something up. And this is the kind of thing that almost no automatic code formatter will use, which will do, which is why I never use an automatic code formatter. I always like to do things as clearly as possible for a human, even if that means typing an extra space myself manually. So then let's return the parts and the symbols. And so now we can say, parts comma symbols equals pars our matrix. Check the parts. So, you know, I'm really slow, right? I just check everything as I go. But like, if the thing was originally presented to us like this, we'd probably not find it particularly difficult, right? You'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense. all in the format that we want at this point. All right, so then always nice to just keep reminding yourself what the problem looks like. Cool. So we want to know which parts are adjacent to a symbol. So, let's pick a part and a symbol. Look at them. Because our brains are pretty good at dealing with single things, right? Is this symbol adjacent to this part? very suspicious about this. I think our symbols are wrong. Are they? Yes, they are. They're always y equals 0. Ah, also here, y equals 0. So I made the mistake. I printed things out as I went, but I didn't bother to read them. Cool. And you can see why, right? y equals 0. So let's fix those two things. So we want parts. Y equals row. Y equals Y, rather. Okay, and then symbols. Y equals Y. And then something I like to do a lot is to say clear and run all. And that's more like it. Cool. All right. So let's see. y equals 1 is adjacent to y equals 0. So that makes it look like they're next to each other there. This goes from 0 to 2. And this is 3. So yeah, it looks like it is. And yeah, it is. All right. So I could basically say like, right, OK. You know, this is the kind of thing I'm always like, well, I don't know. I can type it, I suppose. Or particularly because I can kind of type it in a nice way, right? I basically want to make sure that p.x1, let's think about this. We want to make sure that the symbol x has to be greater than p.x1. or equal to, and that one there is minus one because it can be diagonal, right? So it's got to be less than that. And then the symbol.x has to be less than or equal to the parts x2 plus one. And again this is where it's nice that we kind of fixed up those edges as we went, so it's more symmetrical and I don't know if you've seen this before, but this is one of these things that might be a bit easier if we did that. This is quite a common pattern in Python. This means that this is between these two numbers. Okay, so we want it to be between those two numbers. And we also want the parts y minus 1 to be within the bounds for the y. So like if it's not nice and symmetrical it's always useful to think about y, right. So this one, this one should be true, and it is. Okay, so that's nice. So add a copy and we'll say def And then I'd say is, I always like to like use is for my notation for things that are kind of like is something true. So is adjacent. Is this part adjacent to this symbol? And because I use the same things in my parameters, I don't have to worry here about changing anything else. So I won't accidentally have a bug there. So then I'll say is adjacent. I mean, look, obviously this should work. It's the same code, but I still run it just because I'm that anal. Okay, cool. So hopefully you can see why this is quite nice, right? Because all I need to do is go through, to know whether it has a symbol next to it, is to go through all the symbols and see if it's adjacent to my part, right? So remember, I've got my symbols. There they are. And so I want to go through all of them and see if they're adjacent to my part. Now that's interesting because again, we want the more varying thing to come first. Because it just makes life easier. Because now we can just say, oh yeah, let's go through all the symbols. And for each one, going to see if it's adjacent to my part. Let's see, so I've gone through all my symbols. Check if it's adjacent. So my symbol comes in first. Rerun. Oh, symbols.map p equals p. My bad. There we go. So yeah, the first one's adjacent. And so we can now say, has adjacency, right? Does, um, part have any adjacency has adjacency for my part. And I want to check it has an adjacency if any of these are true, right? one does have an adjacency. And so which ones do we want to keep? We want to keep the ones which do have an adjacency. They said sum up all of the… I always forget. Sum up all the part numbers, and a part is something that is next to a symbol. let's go through then, and we'll see, let's go through all of our parts. So make sure we know what they look like. So there's all of our parts. Parts. Okay, filter. All of those that have an adjacency. And kind of when you write this out, It should sound a lot like English, right? Go through the parts, filter out to find the ones that have an adjacency. Should there be eight of them? I think there was, right? Yeah, there's only two that aren't. Okay, go through all the parts that have an adjacency and sum them up. Okay, getting pretty close. wrong there. Oh right, we didn't want to sum up their d attributes. Okay, so to grab all of their d attributes there's a thing in Python's data library called attrGetter which grabs all of something with an attribute. And so in this thing we have something called attrGot. We want to grab all of the d's. Okay, so there's the d from everyone. So go through parts, find out the ones with the adjacency, grab their D attributes and sum them up. Okay, getting better. This one here we've called symbols but we didn't actually pass it in, so let's pass it in. That's important. Okay, which means this one we now need to add How's that looking, Yaku? 4361. Cool. So I got the right answer. So that's kind of what you want to see. It's like if we have a bug, we don't have to look through 50 lines of code, you know. We just look at one at a time. It also helps in like when we switch to the input. if you have a bug, you know, you can kind of do it in much smaller pieces as well. I don't remember, I think we already grabbed the input, right, in our template. Yes, we did, cool. So all we need to do now is basically go through and see what we did. So we went, okay, we did m equals sample dot split lines. Copy, paste. Oh yeah, we did parse, didn't we? So then we did parse. Let's find that. Parse. Cool. So copy, paste. And I think that's basically it. Then we did this one here. And then that becomes imp. Okay. Submit. All right. 544664. There we go. 544664. So I'm going to wrap it up there. We've got one more part. But the reason I want to wrap it up there is the exercise I want you all to go through is to replicate that style, and then part B of the puzzle, can you do it in the same way? And it should be like very small, you know, because you've got basically the parser already, the idea of adjacency already. So, you know, have a go at that. Yeah, cool. Any thoughts before we wrap up, Jaakko? No, I think my only thoughts is Even myself, I've been programming for quite a while, been adopting the style a little bit more. How's it going? I mean, I imagine it's a bit of rethinking required because you're a very experienced programmer. Yeah, I think there is a bit of rethinking and sometimes it can feel like a bit slower, but it's one of those things. It's like go slow to go fast. And I see... some other solutions. The thing I like about it is I'd like to come back to it six months from now, and I think I'd still be able to read all those little functions easily and see all that. And you can run an experiment with them. Yeah, exactly. Which is something that's very often not true of bad code. Also, you might have forgotten how find itter works by then. I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't because you know it, but people were less experienced with it. And now it's there, because you could be like, oh, why did the y-ness 1 there? It's like, oh, you can see, oh, it's more consistent this way. Yeah, exactly. So I think that sort of self-documenting nature is very handy. And some things work better with loops and an imperative style, and we'll come across those soon enough. You know, this is just a case of having more tools in your toolkit. And you can see also the way we're modifying our tools to work in a way. So a lot of tools in Python 3, they changed from 2 to 3 to make it more focused on speed rather than working well on a REPL. So for things which is nearly always we don't care about speed, you only care about speed in the inner loop of a thing that is slower than you need it to be. So in those cases, fine, you might need to go back and use some of Python 3's approaches, but we're modifying things to work the way we want them to in this interactive environment because we want to interact with them constantly. So I think that's something people don't do enough of, I find, is modifying stuff so it works in a way that's convenient. And I think the other thing that's really nice about this approach is it's unlike a Java or something where the thing that you're modifying might be like three classes over And so you're constantly having to jump all over the place and you modify something here and that then has a knock-on effect, which on the third file that you weren't really thinking about, now it's like everything here is like in the one context, which I think you can really appreciate. And Yaku, I don't think I've talked to this with you before. So what's your relationship with regular expressions? Are you in the... oh, they're useful, we'll reach them, but I have to, but they're such a pain, or are you in the like, oh, I dream about them, or where are you in the regular expression? I definitely don't dream about them too often, but I do like them just because, yeah, like I've used them enough that they're kind of relatively getting easy. So you will have experienced this thing, though, of a lot of folks bet some of your colleagues actively avoid them or be like, no, don't use that, too confusing. Yeah. And I think what we often do at work, if it's a particularly, like there are many parts to the regular expression as we'll document, like, okay, like the first part's doing this, it's like have a doc string beneath it even for yourself like coming back to it a while later it can just help yeah maybe we'll look at that later at some ways of documenting and splitting up regular expressions there's some neat approaches for that so i think my message for people today is if you're new to them you recognize that um all you need is square brackets plus and star basically you know um Even dot, you know, dot means anything. You can create dot with square brackets, but it's easier just to have dot. And that's all you need. We'll learn about parentheses shortly as well, which is a nice little addition. But with, you know, with find iter, square brackets, including the carrot version. So a set, the complement of a set. So they're your character classes or anything at all. Yeah. Followed by star, zero or more. plus one or more gets you a really long way and there are other nice things you know as you were saying people can sometimes be a bit worried about like oh it can be slow because you've done a regex or whatever so in in this jupiter type environment something i like to do is use like the at time it um or percent time it um so that it you can very quickly just test like okay, if I have this big input, how fast is it gonna be? And you can get your ranges on like what to expect. Yeah, and regular expressions are written in C, right? So actually most regular expressions are gonna be much faster than doing something by hand in Python. If you try to get too tricky, it's possible to construct regular expressions, which are ridiculously slow. And we did see this recently with one of the Advent of Code 2024 things where people were constructing some rather hairy regular expressions causing Python to take more than two minutes to solve it and we're saying hey Jeremy solve it's broken. That's like I don't know what the nice way to say is like no man your regular expression's broken but yeah keep them simple and if they take a really long time then yeah try to split it up and simplify it or ask solve it for help. Okay so we've got a few weeks off until January the 6th or something like that. So this is a great opportunity to practice what you've been learning. You know, maybe try writing some documentation. Maybe try writing some meeting notes. Maybe try doing some things you didn't think you could do before. Maybe try doing day 25 of previous things. Maybe, you know, like pick something that's maybe, you know, learning something that you didn't feel like you understood. Like, I don't know, dynamic programming or... You know, do something that was a bit beyond you, or you've previously found menial, or you've previously been told you're not particularly good at, and try to solve it for you. And try doing stuff in Cursor, in Cloud Projects, in Colab, in whatever, and share, you know, your experiences. Because a lot of people are asking us, hey, how do we use these ideas at work, you know? where we use VS Code, or we use Zed, or we use Cursor, or we use Visual Studio, or whatever. And how do I do it in a way that fits well with my colleagues who don't use these styles? How do I work with NBDev to export things? These are all things that we need you to help us with, right? Because we've only got the experience of using this at AnswerAI. When I answer AI, we're all using it and we all use NBDev and, you know, we don't necessarily know the answers to these questions. So we would love help, share your experiences, build new tools and have a lot of fun, of course, with Shell Sage. Thanks for joining us today, Yaku. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody.

Great. Sorry about that. Okay. Jono has mysteriously morphed into Nate and Yaku. I don't exactly know how that happened, but hello, Nate. Hello, Yaku. Thanks for being here. Happy to be here. I want to say hi, Yaku, so your face appears. Hey everyone. Yaku is actually in Queensland, but not actually in front of that particular island display. Where's your island display from today, Yaku? It's constantly changing, I know. This particular island display is up in the Whitsundays. That's actually where they filmed Pirates of the Caribbean. Definitely recommend. checking it out if you come to Australia. Yeah going sailing in the Whitsundays is one of the best experiences of my life I've got to admit. Moving on from sailing in the Whitsundays, a quick logistics notice just you should click stop Solvert in your dashboard and reconnect to make sure you've got the current version because we had a quick little fix to some new functionality we'll show today which is the duplicate button which you'll find there on your server. Today, we are going to start by not using SolveIt, but by instead using something that Nate released this week after giving us all at Answer.ai the great joy of being able to use it for the last few weeks. And it's literally a life-changing experience for me. So without further ado, Nate, tell us what you built and how it connects to all this Solve It bizzle? Yeah, so I created Shell Sage, which is a bit of a mouthful. The code name at Answer.ai is Bash Buddy, which is a lot easier and friendlier. But Shell Sage is an AI assistant right in your terminal. and the really great thing about having a ai assistant right in your terminal is that through the power of tmux it can actually see what you're seeing and this gives it the same sort of context awareness that you see when using SolveIt. So, for example, in SolveIt, when you're writing to the AI assistant, it can see all of your messages above, whether or not that's the code and the output of the code or any notes that you've written to yourself or previous messages from the AI assistant. And so it can give you context-specific information. answers that you wouldn't be able to get if you were, say, copying and pasting your code and stuff into, say, ChatGPT or copying and pasting outputs from a terminal into ChatGPT. And I think what happened is, like a lot of us at AnswerAI now, when we use an archaic system which is not connected like directly seeing what we're working on and connected with an AI, it feels hopelessly obsolete. And so, you know, when we were working in bash on our server, for example, it felt ridiculous to have to do things myself or have to tell an AI what I'm doing and what happened. And so you've basically bought all that to, to the terminal and, oh dear, somebody in the chat, uh, Justin Hong might have to be banned for bad punning. Just like humans, shells age. He put the space in before that. That is just terrible. So, dear. So why don't you, what are you going to give us a demo so we can see it live? Great. I also want to make a quick shout out to to Richard Rees in the Discord. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Actually, I'm going to be going through this one shortly. So he's going to get a big shout out. OK, great. Yeah. OK, great. Yes. So if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, which is great. And we're actually going to do the first step anyways on a new server. So let me go ahead and swap over to that. So I've been teaching the AnswerAI Team System Administration in recent weeks. And we've actually been using Shell Sage as part of that. So everybody now has their own little server that they have launched, a nice fresh server that we used OpenStack to launch automatically from the command line. So I guess this is your fresh new server, Nate. Yes. And it's called Sadmin because I always have issues when it comes to system administration, but Shell Sage is turning that around. So this is a very bare bones installation of Ubuntu 2024. and the only real sort of package that i've added to it is conda so that i can install shellfish this service costing you six dollars a month i believe so yeah we went for the extra two gigabytes of ram we're big ballers here at answer um and so one thing that's really nice with shell sage is you can also use it to bootstrap so if you don't have tmux or anything installed you can also get shell sage to help you out with getting all of that set up. So I can do pip install shell sage to get the most recent version. And we're basically in business. I can type s sage to invoke shell sage. And since I don't have tmux installed, if I were to try and ask it a question, it will first generate an error, which will be fixed in a future version very soon. But if I don't want that, I just have to do dash dash nh, which stands for no history. Basically, don't use tmux. And just a question from the audience here about what kind of computer is this we're logging into. This is from a company called Genesis Hosting. Genesis Hosting, like a lot of folks, uses an open standard called OpenStack, which is really nice. So by using an OpenStack provider, we're able to basically use the same scripts and processes across all the providers we want. Yeah, think about it as like AWS's CLI or GCPs, but actually it's Fain. And open. And open, yes. So let's go ahead and see how to install Tmux. So Tmux is, you're going to be telling us more about it for now, though suffice to say it's something that SalesAge needs in order to provide the context understanding of what you've typed recently and what answers you've got back recently. Yeah. And as you can see, it gives me a few options. So I know that I'm on a Debian slash Ubuntu server, so I'm going to use the apt install version. And then it says I can launch tmux by just invoking the command afterwards. And also I can use a man tmux to get some information about what tmux is. So we'll go ahead and do that. There's no history as in you're saying I don't have tmux installed. So we'll probably remove the need for that pretty soon. It'll check for itself where the tmux is there and maybe give you a warning. Yeah. Isaac gave a really cool way of doing that. So we'll be pushing a new version shortly. All right, so I installed that. I'll go ahead and just open up Tmux's man pages by typing the other command that Shell Sage provided. And so here is basically the actual documentation behind Tmux. It stands for a terminal multiplexer, and it just basically enables creating sessions and managing different types of, like shell environments in a single window in a really clean and easy way. And it's very popular among system administrators. And so we can go ahead and read through this documentation, but we have Shell Sage, so we can use Shell Sage to help us out here. Let's go ahead and launch TMUX. As you can see, some stuff just changed a little bit. I now am in like a fresh new environment. I also have this bar at the bottom that's green that has some information on it. And in the bottom here, you have information about the session you were in. You don't really have to worry about it. We at Answer just usually use one session. And then within that session, we'll use some other stuff like windows or panes, which I'll show you shortly, to have different working areas. And so now let's go ahead and ask Shel Sage, how do I use, to give you a bit of a understanding of how TMux sort of works. Oh, my goodness. Oh, I just... Shell Sage likely knows me a little bit too well. I will just mention something, though, about chatting to language models, which is because they are autoregressive, they've learnt by completing sentences. This might seem surprising, but actually they work better if you type grammatically correctly, use correct capitalization, you know, that kind of thing. The reinforcement learning phase we talked about last time does help them to answer correctly, even when you say, who do TMUX? But, you know, it's actually worth spending time. We could, you know, it'd be probably, maybe we should add a little grammar and capitalization fixer or something to solve it at some point, but we don't currently have that. So it is definitely worth spending time trying to type things carefully to get better answers. Yes, I totally agree. Luckily, Shell Sage was able to understand me in this instance. So it gives me a little bit of information on what are the main things do with tmux as you can see there's this control b which is kind of like entering command mode in tmux and then you have some next sort of key press that will trigger an event for example if i want to create a new window i can do control b c and now i've created a new working space session, or window in this case, where I can run commands that is separate from the one that I was just in. So let's try to focus here on the bit that I reckon everybody ought to know, which I reckon you don't need to know this, I would hit Ctrl D to close this one, and to go back to the original one. And then I would show focus on the split panes, because that's what like, I think everybody probably wants to know how to do. And then with Ctrl B, Z, that is going to really get people uh optimizing their their team the workflows makes sense yeah so um one of the best things if you want to make all of your non-tech friends think you're a hacker is to split your pain into multiple different session into different uh into different pains so control b will uh with uh with the double quotes, we'll do it horizontally. And then with the percent sign, we'll do a vertical split. And then to navigate around, I can use Control-B and then the arrow key. So if I want to go back to the main one, I can Control-B up. And now I am in the top one. And all of these are separate, so they don't conflict with each other or anything like that. So can you show Control-B-Z in that one so that I can maximize that pane? Yeah, so Control-P-Z basically zooms into a particular pane to make it full screen. And now this is super useful if you've done a lot of outputs and you want to zoom into a particular one to focus on doing some specific task. And then if you want to go back to the multi-pane view, you just do Control-B-Z again, and you're back into the multi-pane example here. So the only other ones I would show you perhaps before we jump into Shell Sage would be Control-B-D and Tmux-A because Control-B-D is very nice because it means that you can reboot your computer, go away, come back tomorrow and come back to exactly where you left it, including Jupyter server running, long running training jobs, et cetera. Yeah, so if any of y'all have suffered from SSHing into a server, running something, and then your SSH connection drops or something like that, and you realize that your long-running training job was killed because of it, TMUX is something that you should definitely look into because of this ability to detach and have sessions always going on. So if I do this Control-B-D, I have detached from the tmux session. And now I'm back into my original terminal shell environment before I launched the tmux command. So you can see all of the history is still here and even the commands that I ran. And if I do something like tmux ls, you can see the existing sessions that are currently available in the tmux server. So I have this session 0 that has one window. And if I want to reattach back to it, I would just type in tmux a. And that gets me back into whatever state that I was running in. Any long running commands that I was running here would still be going on without interruption, which is super useful. And a quick question from the chat about Authenticating. So you do need an API key from anthropic for this, we will be adding other LM providers as well. But for now, you need to set the anthropic API key environment variable, which if it's not currently mentioned in the Readme, we will make sure it's added to it. Yes. All right, let's use it. Awesome. Okay, so I have a problem with my server. Shall we Let's do it. Control-B-Z. And so I have a problem with this server. I have unfortunately put in a lot of data, and so my space is getting limited. So I need to get Shell Sage to kind of find out where in my file system I have my largest files so that I can clean them up. So let's go ahead and ask Shell Sage. And this is a place that also voice can work pretty well. Yes, something like transcription with WhisperFlow. We can showcase that in a second as well. But here we can see that Shell Sage has recommended using the sudo du command with a dash ah flag. And it's piping it through a bunch of stuff. But it also gives us exclamation points. explainer for each one of these. So in this case, it's running it with elevated privileges because it's trying to do it on the root, which you can do. But in this case, it's going to probably take a little bit too long for this demo. So we'll change that in a second. And then it's using this du command. So this stands for disk usage. And it's just formatting it for us a little bit. And then it'll pipe that and sort it by the top files and folder usages. So let's go ahead and run this. It actually even gives a quicker result, one for my home directory, which is actually what I want. It even gives me a little warning here that it might take a large time on large systems. Great. Thank you very much, Shell Sage. Okay. It looks like the problem seems to be in my data. Don't tell us. Have it tell us. Okay. All right. Let's see. So let me do it with some voice. Great. I ran the commands. Now what? So it sees the output as well as the history of input. That's the really cool thing about Shell Sage. Yeah. So as you can see, analyzing the output, it's able to tell that Oh, interesting. It hasn't actually used the output very well. Yeah, and it is able to navigate, investigate specific directories. So it does know that it is in home Ubuntu data. But I would have said my request would have been more specific than yours, I would have said something like, Oh, what do you see in this output, or something like this, I think it's quite useful to try and Again, like try and be the human in the driving seat, not just for SolveIt, but also for Shell Sage. I find it works better if I really try to drive towards the answer I'm looking for. Yeah, I agree. Do you think we should give it a little bit more hints or should we? Yeah, why don't you say like, you know, what do you see in these results or something like that? Great. OK, now this is way more specific. I like it. It even gives me the numbers. So it's saying that there seems to be a lot of large video files that are taking up the space, along with some image files. And it even recommends some actions. Oh, also repository with a large Miniconda installation that I probably should clean up. I can investigate further for this particular directory that seems to be taking up the most space. But let's go ahead and give it a little bit more information on what exactly I want to clean up. Just before you do, I'm going to answer a question from the chat, if that's OK. So Thomas asks, if you type in your pseudo password, will it be passed to the LLM? Now the answer is no, but I want to explain why it's no. Solve it. And Shell Sage work exactly the same way, which is that the thing that's passed to the LLM, the information that's passed to the LLM, is the information you see on your screen. So in SolveIt, everything above the current message is sent as you see it, along with context, if you've added that. And here, everything in Tmux is sent. So, Nate, can you just do a control B left square bracket? So control B left square bracket puts you in scroll mode. And then if you press page up a couple of times, You use PageUp? Oh, PageUp. You don't have that on your keyboard? There's PageUp on my keyboard. Should be function up, otherwise. Well, how do you survive without PageUp? There you go. OK. So as you can see, Tmux has been keeping track of all the input and output. And so that's exactly what will be sent. So you won't see the pseudo password there. And so if you don't see it there, Claude's not going to see it either. Um, okay, so let's give it a little bit more of a challenge and let's say that I want to clean up all of the files that are above, um, 300 megabytes. Okay. I want to clean up all of the files in the data directory that are above 300 megabytes. How do I do that? Look good. Great. Awesome. It's interesting to see because my recommendation would be to look at them first. I'd be interested to see if Shell Sage makes that recommendation as well. Because if you've got like, you know, grandma's 95th birthday, do not delete.mp4. You probably want to know that. Yeah, there you go. It is. So. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And also it is moving them. Yeah. Yeah. And so I can also do it with RM and what's even greater is that it uses the proper, you should be using dash I so that you have to confirm whether or not you want those files actually deleted. And it breaks down each one of the bits. So I can also list the files here and make sure that this command is actually gonna do what I want it to do. That one looks good. <|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> And yeah, asked me to consider the different options. So that's great. Yes, I've considered them. Thank you very much. It really wants me to back them up. Its recommendation to gzip them is actually terrible, which is interesting. So remember, these things are not always great. Gziping a MP4 won't make it any smaller at all. Oh, interesting. Good call out. And as you can see with the dash i flag, I have to confirm. I wonder why.

So it's very concise, so it's very easy to work with and understand and it's also early days so it's very small. Also at Answer.ai we tend to value lower complexity more importantly than we value, you know, A lot of the kind of enterprise style software development so it's like much easier to read and work with so yeah anybody who's interested in like contributing to open source, for the first time. This is probably a good opportunity to do so, and you can do it, you know you can use solve it or notebooks or collab or you know stuff like that to try and do it in a more. solve it friendly way practice what you've been learning. Yeah, and also Nate's very helpful and patient. So if you're not sure how to do those things, and there's also the community on the Solve-It channel that's on the Solve, sorry, the Shell Sage channel on the Solve-It server. He can help you. Yeah, I guess one other shout out is that there was a change, and so I'll be hosting the office hours after the class today. With Yaku, I think. Okay, thank you, Nate. I will leave you to keep an eye on admin stuff that's happening. Thank you for joining us today. Great pleasure. Everyone see you on the discord. Okay. And then Yaku. Hello.

And he sort of said that he'd read the docs. Hang on, decorators, right? Say again? Decorators, not generators? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant to say. So Freudian slip if that came out wrong. So yes, decorators. And yeah, he was having trouble understanding it. And he just asked if we could go through that. And so we did do a little bit of a solvent explanation, but yeah, as Jeremy said, we probably could have done a better demonstration of how to do that yourself. So that's what we're gonna do today. All right, let's do it. All right. So what I wanna learn something from Solve It. We're going to assume that we have very limited knowledge today. We're quite new to even Python itself. And we want to learn about decorators. So we're learning something new and quite early. So I'm just going to start off with a prompt. So you're a typer as well, Yaku, or do you use voice input sometimes? I've started using the voice input, but currently Alfred and... Here, I'll show you. See, it's conflicting with the Super Whisper. I need to fix that still. So I'm trying to learn about decorators. I've read the docs, but I just don't get it. So kind of treating this like it's Jeremy and I have my own personal Jeremy and I can ask him questions. I don't have to just watch the videos anymore. I can now actually ask him questions. So, hey, I'm trying to learn about, I read the docs, but I just don't get it. Can you show me some examples? So I wouldn't start there. Let's talk about how best to get the most out of this. Luckily, it's helping you a bit. When you're getting help here, it does help to understand some basic ideas about how best to learn and how best to do education to help solve it, help you. Rather than jumping into examples, you can see here it's asking us some questions. I would start out by saying like, I don't know what, what do you mean functions that take other functions and what that, what's that got to do with decorators or something? Because actually we need to start out by understanding. So I would have started out by saying like, hey, what, what's the basic idea? Can you give me an overview? Okay. Or we can change it. No, don't change it. Let's keep going. Let's go. This is great. We can just cancel. And I would answer question two and say, yeah. Okay. <|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> And that's another good reason to get voice working is it tends to give you better constructed sentences. Yep. So let's start by understanding functions as an argument. This is a key part of decorators. OK. Function can be treated like any other object. So you can assign them to variables. Here's a simple example to try. Would you like me to show you a basic example of passing a function as an argument? Would you prefer to try writing yourself? <|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|> And we've defined something called apply greeting, which takes a function and a name, and then it's going to call that function with the name. So when we have apply greeting, and then we're going to use it by putting in the say hello function and passing it Alice as the name. Okay, so let's try it. So let me just explain how that works to people. So it's like it's not very straightforward. Yeah, go ahead and submit it. I like the way you use the copy up to code there. So in the apply greeting function, the way to think of it is that where it says func in def apply greeting func, that func is going to be replaced with whatever you send it. So we're sending it say hello. So instead of saying func, it will be say hello. And name will be replaced with Alice. So it's going to actually return the result of calling sayHello Alice. And this is literally what functions do. In fact, math is basically replacing symbols with other symbols according to rules, as is computer science. And so when you kind of do it that way, you can work through it in your head to see exactly what's going on. I guess we should ask what on earth this has got to do with decorators, should we? Sure. So decorate is a special way to use this concept. It's a function that takes another function and returns a modified version. So let's build on this example. <|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|sv|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> get name, which we didn't have a get name before. So it seems like it's a slightly different example. Yeah. So maybe we should start then by looking at the, it's just a shorter way of writing colon. So maybe let's copy the bottom line that it's got the ad greeting decors. Yeah. So if you copy that by going to the far right and clicking on the copy button and then press Apple V and then we should try it. Because that's what we do. But we haven't defined this stuff yet. That's true. So prompt. Yes, no worries. So let's click on the previous one to modify it. I can delete it. That's fine. Yeah, OK, you're right. So let's do it a different way. So let's delete the previous one. Get rid of it. OK. delete it. And instead we can modify it. So yes, click delete. And this is actually a useful thing to show people how this actually works. It doesn't want to delete. So let's change. So scroll up so that we can see that. Yeah. Click on the copy this to output button here. Yeah. And we'll see what it actually does is it copies in all of the bits, all of the code, which is quite cool. And so if we just delete the ad greeting decorator and the print, then Get rid of that get name, get rid of the print, everything except get rid of the get name. There we go. That's what we want. Get name is not defined. Oh, it's get name we wanted, not add greeting decorator that we wanted. Yeah. So we'll copy this. But not with the decorator. There we go. Sorry about that, Jaco. That's all right. Oh, so now we should try it. Oh, what the hell? Yeah, we've come out, got this in a bit of a broken state, haven't we? Yeah, oops. Okay, back to this. Nice. Okay, so yeah, now we've got name is Alice, yeah. Okay. And then... We actually wanted the get name equals at greeting decorator. Oh, it's a bit annoying because it's giving it the same name as what we started with. So what if you selected it and made the def called underscore get name, you know, and then get name equals get. Yeah, so we want the whole thing. We just want to do it without the decorator to start with. Okay, I modified to do it without the decorator. So to do it without the decorator. So you delete that. Yeah. And then you use change get name to underscore get name. And then copy their last line of code, which says get name equals at greeting decorator into your output. And then change that. <|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> And we put in a name that we want. So we add Alice. And, okay, so it came back as hello Alice. And our underscore get name returns name. Okay. And then get name returned a function. AddGradingDecorator returned a function. Yes. Returned this new function wrapper that we defined that where wrapper takes in name and then is returning this is an f string so it's going to execute inside of it.

So, I mean, the goal of this isn't to learn about decorators. It's just to kind of walk through the pros and cons of the approach. I think this is useful, right? So we can see, like, in order to learn stuff with SolveIt, we have to be quite intentional. And, you know, you really want to, like, try every example. And anytime there's an example you don't understand, you've got to, like, asking, you know, and keep going into smaller and smaller pieces. And if it tries to go too far ahead, you've got to try to rewind and kind of go through it more, you know, more slowly. So I think something that would be really useful in the office hours, you know, is if there's ideas, you know, libraries, APIs, computer science techniques, anything else that you've had trouble learning, you know, bring them to the office hours or a study group. and work through them, you know, and say like, here's me trying to learn about it. Here's me trying to ask the question. And in the office hours, we might try to really focus on, you know, teaching people how to fish rather than doing the fishing for them, if that makes sense. There's a question in the chat about like, should you delete portions of the conversation if it goes too far off track? I'd say yes, definitely you should, right? If the dialogue's not going in a direction you're happy with, because of the way the language model's trained, it will want to continue to go on in a direction that's not very good. Because in the past, documents it's been trained on, things that tended to go badly, keep going badly. So instead, modify one of its outputs to say what you would wish it had said. <|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> to get your comments or your thoughts on the process basically. So yeah I guess let's see how we go after. So after class today there'll be another office hours and maybe folks can join in and you guys can try this out. Nate will be there too right? Yeah yeah for sure he will be there and yeah we can try that then. Okay super. I've got some more examples of this kind of thing I can show if people are interested. And for these examples I'm going to show a new tool which I really like. And the tool I want to show is something in Claude called projects. So projects Here's an example. Projects have a few things in them. One is just you can add a system prompt. So when I was kind of experimenting with teaching kids calculus, I just added a system prompt. So that's kind of the most basic starting point. And then you can see, you know, doing calculus. And one nice thing in Claude is that it can output artifacts, which are fun. And so we kind of used that to kind of ask for examples. And I was trying to help the kids kind of get a sense for the basic ideas behind calculus. The more interesting part, however, is that you can add context. Now Discord, I was creating a Discord helper which would let me right click on something in Discord and choose get message link. it would basically create a bookmark of that message that I could look up and jump to later. I had never used Discord API before so I basically grabbed all of the documentation that I thought might be necessary and turned them into markdown files. So let's just have a quick look example of that. Often it's quite difficult to kind of scrape documentation. Often it uses JavaScript. It often has like, like Google's ones have some kind of bot detection. I don't know why you'd do that because it's really good to have bots using it. But a really good way to do this is if you right click on docs, choose inspect. And then if you press left arrow until you can see basically the entire area that you want is selected like so. And then you can just say copy out of HTML. And then I created this thing called web2md.answer.ai that you can paste that into. And underneath, you can see it's turned into Markdown. And then what I normally do is I then click on gist it. Right, and we now have a gist that contains that documentation. We should have given it a markdown name so it would actually appear as markdown. There we go. And then what I do is I then add that to my Claude project. And so you can see there they all are, right? And so with this, and then I added a system prompt, say like help me create a Discord app and then I would just kind of ask it basic questions like I would like to create an application in Python for Discord in which I could right click on a message in a server and it would send a link to that message to a DM to me so that I could effectively bookmark it for later. Based on the documentation provided, does this sound like something that should be possible using this approach? So don't be too concise. Tell it everything you want. Give it all the information you need. And this is kind of where I started. The other thing I forgot to do here, because I started doing this back before this was an issue, is I would go back to this here, and I would say don't use artifacts, because they're not at all useful for Python. Save instructions. Just while we're on this screen, Jeremy, could you show quickly where the just was useful there? where the gist was useful. Actually, I guess in this case, what was important was the, well, yeah, I can show you. You could actually just paste it in. So maybe in this case, the gist wasn't necessary. You could just copy. So let's go back to the project, Discord. Yeah, so when you say add knowledge, you can either upload or add text. So yeah, you actually want to either save the file locally or paste it. So I guess actually in this case, the gist wasn't so useful. Yeah, thanks for checking. So now that we've modified that to say please don't use the totally pointless artifacts, which it's really overenthusiastic about, it should give us something much more. prosaic. So you can see. Where was that? Sorry. Now I've lost where I was doing it. Anyway, so I used that to create that Discord thing and also to kind of document it as I went. And a similar idea, Richard created a nice tutorial here for Shell Sage using the same approach, I believe, which is adding the context to a project being the kind of existing documentation that they created. And one thing that's really helpful is that in these cases, Richard exported a gist of the Claude project output. Unfortunately, there isn't something built into Claude currently to do that. But my colleague and friend, Hamel, has kindly made one. So you can go to Claude Save and get an extension that will save it in exactly this format, as you see. So let me give you some tips for kind of how to create good documentation and other things you can do with this. So one thing I did was I wanted to create documentation about a library I created called Fastlight. And so I tried to make sure I asked very specific questions to be like the kinds of things that I really wanted people to know the answers to. So what does Fastlight add to SQLite Utils? you know, okay, show an example of doing this, show an example of doing this. And I'm not really getting it to just write the documentation for me. I'm trying to get it to write the things that I want to kind of add to my documentation. So again, it's like pretty much a dialogue between the human and the computer, even though I'm not in Solve It here. This is one of my favorite ones. Actually, sorry, not this one. This one's one of my favorite ones. One of the best books I've read for many years is this book by the guy that created HTMX and some other folks. And it's basically all about how to create web applications from a deep understanding of the fundamentals of how the web works. And I think it's amazing. And I wanted to be able to provide parts of that to both have something that humans can read, but particularly I wanted something much more concise that a language model can read. So I think I've got something strange here. So let me just do it here. OK. So I don't have the original dialog I used to create this, which is silly of me. I should have kept it. But I can show you how I made it. all of the first chapter of the book into context. And then I basically said like, please summarize this for me. And its first summary was crappy. And I basically kept telling it how to make it better. I'd be like, provide a lot more information, provide a lot more examples, copy things than the original. And I went through about five goes until I got one I liked. I modified it myself, editing a few things I didn't like. I then deleted everything between. And so I ended up with me asking a question and it giving it a great answer. And then for chapter two, I then put chapter two plus the chapter one summary in and said, please create a summary of chapter two using the approach you see of the summary in chapter one. Here are some things particularly to look out for. So I summarized the things that got wrong last time. And the second time I only had to do it like twice to get a really good answer. And you can see like for a whole chapter, it's got, an extraordinary amount of detail and examples, but it's much more concise than the book, right? So it's a really great reference. So again, I deleted the ones that I didn't like as much. And so I added up with something where the answer was exactly what I would have liked, edited it to make it even better. And then for chapter three, I then did the same thing. And then I again added the extra things that were still not quite getting right. And for chapter three, the first time it was perfect, right? And it's got all these great examples. details and then so I just kept adding one chapter at a time and after a couple more goes it then did a bad one again and so this time I actually kept the bad one and I said and I and I left it in the dialogue and said no no no not like that you know look at the earlier chapters to see how to do it right here are the problems and so then chapter five again is great you know it's got all this detail and so I found I can add now this markdown of a chapter to a dialogue and immediately the language model fully understands how to use HTML and HTMX really well. Let's try to see how I get the URL on the screen. Not quite sure how to do that. Sorry. Just trying to get the URL on the screen as well, but it's a bit tricky. I can see it now. Okay, great. I'm just cutting off the very bottom, but hopefully you don't need the very bottom. So let me show another interesting example of this, which is something quite different, which is there's a lot of stuff out there for creating meeting notes. And to me, a meeting shouldn't happen unless it's going to create some really useful output. So for me, we don't have meetings at Answer AI very often at all. And when we do, we have a really high bar for what they're proposed to do. And then so since they're meant to be really good, really useful things, then we want the artifacts from that to be really great. So the normal meeting notes you get from AI tend to be super concise and not really tell you what went on. So when I had a meeting with Hamill, I pasted the whole thing into a cloud project that I use for this purpose, right? So it's like, here's my Zoom meeting. I just paste it in the full transcript. And I said to it, this is key. I said, right, rewrite this to be suitable for publishing in a magazine, right? Combine their contributions so it's less fragmented, clean it up, right? Do not lose any content. This is the most important thing. Just do the first eight paragraphs. And then stop. And so then here's the entire... Oopsie-daisy. Here's the... So I've got a brand new keyboard, which was possibly a mistake to use this because it's a really strange layout. Okay. So here's the whole transcript. And then it's like, okay, here's a rewrite. <|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|><|pl|> And I just keep going small bits at a time. And it ends up with a super nice shareable artifact that I shared with my team. And people really appreciated it. People were like, wow, that was such an interesting thing to got a lot of information out of this. Yeah, so it's probably a bit different, right? I mean, it probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to do rather than like zero minutes. But for sharing something that's meant to be a really high quality artifact from a really important process of like, you know, multiple people are going to be reading or watching this thing, I think it's really worth doing. Another example was I wanted to teach people how to use Fast HTML, like what's the purpose of them? So I included all, you know, a lot of the hypermedia book I just showed you, the summary of it in the project. And also the Fast HTML, some of the docs. And so I'm being really very quite focused here on what I'm trying to get out of it. And hoping to kind of think about the kinds of things that people often misunderstand. Like, well, what the hell is actually a hypermedia application? So that's another example of trying to do the kind of FAQ based on things I'm actually getting asked on the Discord to get the kind of answers that I want. So I find that useful. I also did the same approach because FastHTML is based on Starlet. I wanted a really good manual for Starlet. People understand the architecture of a fast HTML application. Again, I'm just providing it. And the nice thing about this approach is that each time I build these, I can use more and more of them in the context for the language model. And so they just keep getting better and better. And that's kind of what we're looking for, right? If you let the language model drive a process, they're generally going to get worse and worse because of kind of the limitations of these kind of autoregressive approaches. But when you're doing this kind of approach, each dialogue you create is better than the last one. Each prompt response was better than the last one, you know? So again here, like what are the components of fast HTML? How do they work together? And you know, again, I'm kind of showing examples that I want them to show me how to do it. And so I tend to kind of, sometimes I provide these gists directly as links from the docs. Sometimes I'll go in and edit the gist, right? And so then this is really important because then when I use this as an input context for another Claude project, right? I can tell Claude like, oh, look out for the notes from me where I've pointed out places that previously a model misunderstood it. Here's another one. And it's also for humans, you know, humans, humans that read these things and computers are going to be pretty similar. So Jeremy, if you wanted to summarize another book, would you maybe, and it was like web related, would you then maybe start by taking a section of your HTMX thing that you've done or the whole thing and putting that in first? Yeah, if I'm looking for something similar where it's kind of quite a technical book with examples, I would probably say like I'm looking to convert this chapter and include all the examples just like I did with this chapter with those examples. Absolutely. So as you know, Yaku, and I assume this is why you're asking this question, this is called in context learning in AI. And it basically means giving examples of desired outputs for inputs. Language models work dramatically better, like way, way better when it's in context learning. The problem is most people don't know how to do that because it's not particularly clear what the examples should be. If I had examples, I wouldn't be asking the question. So here we're building up a library of examples. And again, the kind of the idea here is we're trying to get in this really positive reinforcement loop where every time we use AI, we get better at it and the model gets better at it, exactly. Great. Okay. So maybe we'll have a five minute break before we jump into Advent of Code. And when I come back, I will also check the chat to see if anybody has any questions. Sound good, Jaakko? Sounds good to me. Okay. Thank you, sir. All right, I'm back. Are you back, Yaku? I am now, yep. We're all back. I was busy reading the Zoom comments. Excellent. Sorry, the YouTube comments. Actually, I'm not quite organized as it turns out. I think I'm organized. All right, are we ready for some Advent of Code? And what are we doing? Day three, right? Day three. Okay, so hopefully you've all had a try at this already. So let's remind ourselves as to what we're doing. And I think you're sharing, Jeremy. Okay, I should probably do that then.

Any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a part number. So we're getting our notation. Okay, so there's a part number. Periods are not symbols. Okay. Great. copy that, and we've got a new feature called duplicate, thanks to Jono. So to do, to use that I've now created a little advent of code template, which actually I guess I could also add a little bit of help to here by saying input equals get data actually before I do that we should run all, so I get some help for autocomplete. Get data, okay, year equals 2023, and day equals three. Great. And really matter what the day is because we're going to be just using this as a template. So then I'm just going to go duplicate. Then I'll click on it. And edit the title here to AOC Day 3. Maybe worth leaving the day empty in your template so you don't accidentally forget to change it. I've been caught with that once or twice with you using the wrong days input. That's a really good idea. Okay. AOC day three, part one. Okay. Okay. Import. Column 50 say. Okay, so that's our sample. C code. Okay. Okay, sample. Okay, there we go. Okay. So what I've noticed is often people seem to find the parsing bit the hardest. I think with the solver approach the parsing bit for me is always the easiest. And the trick is just to go into smaller and smaller pieces for the parsing. make the smallest bit work and then gradually build back up again. Now in this case, the goal here is we need to find all of the numbers which have a symbol next to them. So I kind of like to think about what an ideal data structure for that would look like. And I guess rather than this current one, Now what I really want to know is where are the numbers and where are the symbols? Where are the numbers to know if it's next to a symbol? I need to know where the number starts and where it ends. Now I happen to know how to do that, but let's assume we don't. So we can ask. What is a concise and easy way in Python to find all of the places where a string of digits starts and stops inside a larger string? It's not always easy to explain exactly what you want. You'll notice often, as is the case here, I misspoke and re-spoke, and generally these modern voice-to-text things tend to do a perfectly good job of figuring out You don't have to worry about it too much. Okay, ari.findita. So something that Nate added recently, which is really nice, is that any time that you in your prompt or note or the assistant in its response has a function in backticks, it provides a hyperlink to it. So a key, key, key thing. is any time that something comes up that you didn't previously know about in Shell Sage or Solvert or Claude or whatever, is stop and go learn about it, right? And that's why this has been made as convenient as possible. Okay, so here is find iter. I'm just going to turn my Discord off because it keeps beeping. There we go. find iter return an iterator yielding match objects over all non-overlapping matches oh that sounds interesting non-overlapping for re pattern and string now the thing about documentation like this is it's super concise because it uses bits of jargon as a shorthand right which is a perfectly fine thing to do as long as you always look up the jargon and the jargon is generally in good documentation like python is going to be a hyperlink An iterator, what the hell is that? An object representing a stream of data. Each time you call next, you get different successive items in the stream. Again, it's a bit of an infinite tree of jargon, but over time you'll learn these ideas, these core ideas, and you'll be able to read them more quickly. What the hell is a match object? A match object. OK, well, basically, the key thing to know about an object is what can it do. So you read through it. It's got an expand. It's got a group. A group can take zero or more group IDs. And then the key thing is the examples. So I would read all that. But for now, I guess the key thing we want to know is basically, how does it work? and basically how does it work is what's the signature of it. So if you just pop a question mark there, okay, then you find out. Okay, it's find, iter, pattern, string, flags, and a quick summary. Okay. Okay, regular expressions. I know regular expressions, so I am Because I know regular expressions. Regular expressions are amazing. They have a very, very unfair reputation as being difficult. And I think the reason for that is that they are a concise notation, you know, like math. example. And things with a concise notation cannot be read at all like math by somebody that doesn't know the notation. It just looks mysterious, right? But just like to a Chinese speaker, Chinese is not hard to read, English is. To an English speaker, you know, Chinese is hard to read. An unfamiliar notation will be unfamiliar until you learn it. But that doesn't mean it's hard to Regular expressions makes things easier, much easier. And there's a small subset of regular expressions that I will teach you so that you will know enough to be this person. But yeah, don't let it bother you that they look strange. Basically, a regular expression is something that allows you to search through a string to find substrings that match a pattern. And so we're going to describe what some of those things are. Let's first of all create a joined version of the sample, just a smaller version. I'm just going to go sample.replace And replace a new line with nothing at all. And we'll start playing with it. Okay. So a regular expression takes a pattern. What's a pattern? It's a string. So just to make this a little bit less typing for me, I will go from re import findIDA. Okay. So I can now just type findIDA. And the first thing I need is a pattern, right? So here's a really simple pattern. Four. What does four find? Four finds a four. That's actually, let's do a seven just to make it more interesting. Okay, where do I find it in? Inside my string ss. And findIDA returns an iterator. So basically you'll get this kind of thing a lot in Python when it says iterator. Basically what that means is that you get something that you could then loop through later to get all the answers from it. To do that all in one go, I can simply do this. Now that's a lot of work. So let's not do that. Let's instead say define findItter. And this is basically a way, a totally standard way, you can always wrap a function and get it to do something else. If you say star args star star keyword args, that basically says pass through everything that you get sent off to something else. We just say return list re.findItter. Because I want this to work for me, I want it to work the way I want it to work. And I always want to be able to see the list. So modify your environment to make it work the way you want. So now that we've done that, we can get rid of list. Great. Just little things. slightly easy, easier to deal with. Okay, so what's it done? Well, it's looked for all the places that the pattern matches in the string. The pattern is 7, so it's told me that it's found it's matched to 7 at 2 comma 3. Okay, now immediately we've seen something that a lot of people on the Discord messed up, which is span is the start and the end, but be careful because look, 0, 1, 2, this is 2, that is the start, the end is past the end, right? So be very careful. It starts at 2 and 3 is just past the end. Which is like, it's not bad, right? Because the difference between the two is 1 and this is of length 1, that's fine, right? But just be careful. So you can see that by studying our data as we go, it really helps, right? So we found all the sevens. Do you think they do that so you can slice it nicely? Fits with the slice notation? Yeah, exactly. Ranges work this way. Pretty much everything in Python works this way. Yep. I think that's a great point, Jakko. So no complaints about it, but certainly an easy mistake to make. But again, we read the docs and then we tried it. then we looked at the answer and so we've got everything we can now, you know. And so being in too much of a hurry with Advent of Code to like win the speed race can be a bit of a mistake because what we actually want you to do is maximize the learning race here, which is another good reason to do the 2023 version because at this point you're not going to get on the leaderboard. Okay, now being able to find the sevens is somewhat useful but not super useful. Let's find the digits. So here's where what I would do is I'd press command shift up arrow and that creates a new cell with the same as the last cell. And I'm going to show you the first thing to learn about. I'm just going to show you a really minimal set of things which will get you a really long way. The first thing I want to show you is that you can type in a set of things to look for. And a set is always in square brackets. So I want to find anything in that set. All right, so there they all are. So that's found four, six, seven, one, one, four. Okay, I'm gonna close that up. Don't quite need all that on my screen at once. That's enough to know, right? But obviously that's a little bit annoying to type all that. So it might be useful to know that you can instead use a hyphen to say everything between 0 and 9. You can also do a to z, and there's the same thing. And now we're at the point where it's like, you don't need to learn, this is called a character class, right? So this is a character class, it's all, everything in this set. For what it's worth, some character classes are used enough that people have even shorter shortcuts for them. So identical to this is backslash D. Backslash D means a digit. You never need to use it. You can always use square bracket naught to nine. It's slightly less typing to write backslash D. There is, however, a bit of a problem, which is we need to put an R in front of it, and I'll show you why. If I write print, backslash n, for example, as you might know, that's not actually a backslash followed by n. That's actually a newline character. So in Python, to say I actually made a backslash, you can write an r at the front, and that means everything in this string, a backslash means a backslash. It means don't turn them into anything fancy. R, you can think of it as R for regular expressions, because this is where you use them all the time. So basically, anytime you're using a regular expression, it's not a bad idea to get into the habit of typing R apostrophe or R double quotes all the time. Okay, great. So we've learned about character classes, and I said that we're going to try to stick to the minimal necessary bit. So then the second main thing to know about in, um, regular expressions is that after a character class, which could, this is a character class, this contains number seven, it's a set of possible things. This contains the set of those things. After that, you can then, um, add, uh, a second character to say, how many times do you want that to appear? By default, you want it to appear once. So there's a single four, a single six, a single seven. Okay. Um, If I want one or more times, plus. Plus means the previous character plus one or more times, which is actually what we want, right? So if we submit that, then I think we can agree that's looking pretty good. 4, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 35. You see? And they're not overlapping. So there's all the places that we want. So Dr. Mikko on the chat says he quite likes writing regexes, but finds them hard to read. And they're hard to read in the same way that math is hard to read, which is two possible reasons. One is you don't know some of the symbols. And the second is you try to read it too fast. So the only way to read a regular expression is to go through every single piece bit by bit. Now one way that can make that a lot easier is to go to somewhere like regex101.com and paste in your test string without the quotes and in your regular expression and say this is a Python regular expression and notice here how it says oh I'm always going to put an R in front of it by default so that's nice and you can see exactly what's going on right zero to nine match the single character present in the list zero through nine okay followed by single character, plus matches the previous token, one to infinity times, and then here you can see all the matches. Okay, so this is a a good way to, you know, check your understanding, but also as you can see solve it's also a good way to check your understanding. So let's try that then. This is looking pretty good. Let's try it in Samp. Again, this is why you, you know, want to do this stuff carefully. Make sure it all works and like, oh look at that. That worked too. So we don't really need that SS thing. So I'll just delete that. Is the ss closer to what the real one is going to look like to me? Oh no, they have the backslash n's in there, don't they? Yeah, they have the backslash n's and we actually care about what line it's on. Yeah, that's right, sorry. So, we actually need to know something. This is not quite the right answer. Like, you could turn this into the right answer, to be honest, because each line is some particular length. So, It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's 10 long. So if we did this integer divided by 10, it tells you what row it's on. And if you did this mod 10, it would tell you what column it's on. But why use math when you don't need to? I'm not a huge fan of that idea. So instead, we're going to try and do it a bit smarter, a bit simpler. And I'm going to just go back, so I've got a somewhere around a neat little, yeah this, I'm just going to steal this. I'll show you this in a moment because it comes up quite a lot. So I always like to be able to visualize things easily. I should probably put this actually in my template because it comes up so much. But here's a command called show. And it's going to go through each row in some matrix. When I say matrix, it's just a list of strings. And it's going to print it out along with some numbers. And I'll just show you what that looks like. So if I say show samp. Oh, what did I do wrong? Ah. So first of all, exactly, so before I would do that I would always say lines equals samp dot split lines. And very often I like to run, I've modified something up here, I want to modify, run everything below. So don't forget we have a run below button, so that runs all my messages below. And obviously this then needs to be lines. Okay, so I think that's a bit easier, right? Because now I can immediately kind of see the coordinates of everything. And so I can kind of more easily now check whether I'm getting back the coordinates I want. So 4, 6, 7, I want to see something saying, oh, it starts at 0, 0 and ends at 0, 3, just one past the end, or 0, 2, depending on how we do it. Maybe we want 0, 2. And then like 35 starts at 2 comma 2 and ends at 2, 3 or 4, so forth. So the row it's on is actually pretty straightforward. That's just going to be the row number as I loop through each one. And the column, we know how to get that for the start and the end, we can get from find . So that feels reasonably straightforward, right? We can So when the lines represent a matrix, I often like just to call it m, because there's nothing particularly special about them being lines, right? So perhaps you folks remember from last time, we've seen that you can go for i comma o in enumerate, and that just, oh yeah, and you always need parentheses in my list comprehension. Okay. So there's my row numbers. It's kind of quite nice, along with each one. And so then for each one we want findItter. And we want to find the digits. So let's grab that. And we could even say, like, digitsRe is this. Okay. And then we'll just go copy and paste. And rather than O, we will say, well, we've got our new special find data, which listifies it for us, which is rather nice. And so first of all, we pass in the pattern. And then we pass the thing to search through. So here we go. 0 has two things, 4, 6, 7, and 1, 1, 4. Nice. 1 has nothing. 2 has two things. 4. Yeah, it looks pretty good. 9 has two things. That looks pretty nice, right? So what I like to do now, then, is to think about like, OK, well, be the nicest possible way to have this? It's basically like, oh I want a little object which has the row number and the start and stop column, and also what digit it is, right? So something I find really useful for this is to be able to like instantly create any object I want. And there's a nice little thing in Python called simple namespace. And I use it so much I tend to give it a different name. I tend to call it NS. And so basically you can create it like this. You just start creating a little object. There's my little object. So I want to create something for parts. They said a part is a string of digits. So as usual, I would call it underscore part. And it's going to take two things. It's going to take the y that it's on, which is here, okay, and it's going to take the match object, which I'll call mo. And so we're going to return, okay, and what are we going to return? We need the span So let's just come back to that. So let's grab one of these, right? Let's grab, if we grab this, give this a name. Sorry, not that. Yeah, grab this. Which one do we really want? We just want one match object to play with. So how about we just grab this and we'll call this matchObjects. And so that way it's going to be easy to play with one, right? So matchObject equals matchObjects zero. MatchObject. Okay, great. So this is where you can just save a bit of time. How do I grab the starting point, the ending point, and the matched string converted to an integer for a single match? mo.start, mo.end, and mo.group. So return, okay, a namespace containing, so our starting x I'll call x1 equals mo.start, our end2 we'll call mo.end, I think I want the start and the end to be semantically the same, so I'm going to subtract one from it because that's actually where it ends. And then we've got the y, of course, which we can just pop here, and then the digit equals int mo.group. Okay, so Now that we've done that, of course, we should immediately test it. So underscore part, and we're going to be passing in y. So for the first part that's 0, and the match object is mo. And there we go. How's that looking, Yaku? It's looking pretty good. I guess one question I had, Jeremy, it's just with the namespace. Maybe you said that while I was out. Do you just prefer that over like a data class because of more concise writing? Or is there another reason you like that one? Sure. So Yaku's asking about this approach here called a data class, which we could absolutely do, which is where you add a decorator. since we've been seeing decorators. And so this is going to be something, it doesn't just take a function and return a function, it can also take a class and return a class. And so we could create a capital P part. And we could say x1 which is an int. And x2 is also an int. Oops, you did the wrong button. And y is also an int. And our digit is also an int. And that's totally fine as well. Sorry, what did I do wrong there? Oh, x1 colon int. Don't mind me. just don't know Python. Okay, and so then you can do the same kind of thing. Now one nice thing about data classes is that as long as you stick to the same order, you define them, you don't have to say all the equals. So if I go x1, x2, yd, I can say x1, sorry yeah x1, x2, yd. That's totally fine too. Yeah, you know, for me, I don't know. This is an extra step. I don't like extra steps. This was less steps because I still need to write underscore part, you know, but I'm fine with either. They're both nice that they print out. One nice thing about data class is it prints out the type of thing or else this one has no type. It's just a namespace. All right. So, what we now want to do is we want to get, for every row, we want to get every part. So, I would be inclined then to say, like, I've got some particular row, m, 0, and let's do things in really, really small steps. Okay, so there's my first row. There was a question, Jeremy, where you've got underscore part, and then you've got a zero and an MO. They're wondering why zero? Yeah, because this is what we're going to be going through, right? We're going to be going through all the rows. And so on each row, we're going to have the row number and all the matches. So that's where we get our Y from. Yeah. So in this example, we're just looking at the first row, and that's what the zero is. Exactly. So this match here was on the first row. index 0, yep. Cool, so we basically could now just grab this, right, put that in a function maybe, so we'll copy and paste. We've already got that re defined, so let's just say def row matches Okay, so we're going to be going through the row. And actually, you know, I'm making a mistake here, aren't I, because I'm trying to do it in too many steps, so let's get rid of the def for now and actually do it for real. What I'm going to be doing then is that's my, you know, that's my row matches. Oh, and I guess digre was 0 to 9 plus. Oh, so it's actually, we're not looping through anything. we're just doing, ah yes, actually what we want to do, oh we don't even need a numerate. Okay, so that's actually pretty straightforward. So it's good that we're doing this in small steps. So we want find iter, that's our row matches, in our row. And so now we want to create parts from that. So if we now loop through each one of those. And so we'll call that row parts actually. We loop through each one of those. Okay, so here they all are. Okay. And we're going to want to call underscore part. And remember underscore part. the match object and the y. So these are both in the first row, and the match object is going to be something that's coming out of this. Now, so they're the two things, so that's good. So something interesting about this is that we're just calling a function on everything in some list. So what I'd be inclined to do then is to change our definition of part. So it's always nice to have the thing that varies come second, and you'll see y in a tick. So we're gonna get lots of matches per y. So let's put the y second. Check that still works. does. And what that means we can do is say, come a second, is we can say l findEta So create a, oopsie-daisy, create a part. Don't know how that happened. Create a part for every match object, right? Now each of those parts needs to know what the y is, so we can then say y equals zero. So either is fine, but I'm just showing you this way to say there's a kind of a way of just getting a bit more into the flow of these things by recognizing that basically you're just list processing, you know, and you can just like, oh, I'm just mapping a function, I'm just mapping a function. Neither is necessarily better or worse. So this is row matches. And it's for, it's quite nice to see, like, what do we need exactly? We need a row and we need a y, okay? So, y, comma, row. And so we can just check that works. Row matches, zero, comma, row. Probably a good idea to return it. Okay, so this might look familiar, zero row. What's row? Remember, that's our row. And so actually then, we can now do this. Think about this, right? We go L, our matrix, right? So that's all of the rows of our matrix. Dot enumerate. So there's all the rows of our matrix with the line number followed by the line. And those are the two things that I want to pass into row matches. Now I've got to be a bit careful here, because probably I want to say dot map. But, Jaco, do you see why that's not going to work? Because row matches wants to take two things. Two things, exactly. And it's going to be sent one thing. It's a tuple. Yeah. Yeah. Tuple's just like a list, but we're going to be learning a lot more about tuples in future lessons. It's a very important data structure. So we want to basically destructure that tuple to send the two things separately. And there's a thing in the standard library in Python called star map, which does map, but does exactly that. It destructures it. And so L has that as well. So L tries to have all the kinds of useful bits with the standard library in it as well. Okay. So we seem to have found 10 parts here. Or not quite. What have we found? We found not 10 parts. Here's a list for the first row. Here's a list for the second row. Here's a list for the third row. So we need to concatenate all those lists together. Yeah. So this is quite often when you do this more functional approach, you often find yourself just clicking on the previous one and adding a little bit to it. And now we seem to have found 10 parts. So I reckon we should double check that. Would dot sum work on that last one as well, Jeremy? Yes. No. Kind of. Yes, I think so. Summing lists should work. Oh dear. What are you doing to us, Yaku? And the reason that works is quite nice. It's because sum just means apply plus. And in Python, applying plus to lists concatenates them. But that was awful. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nice. We found them. So like I said, that wasn't fast, right? But it's not clever. We didn't have to keep anything in our head because we're just doing a little bit at a time. And so now that we've got that, we need the same thing for star. And I'm rather inclined then just to say like, well, okay, this is a part. And like, I like to reuse stuff. So why don't we create a star? And that's going to return, now stars are always one long, so that goes to return an x. And it's not an integer anymore. That should always be a star, but let's change as little as possible. And then We then called so that's how star okay, and then we called row matches We probably should have called that Let's change it now. You know when you like that's that was a mistake. This is a thing that creates parts Parts Because if you kind of later on realize your notation wasn't ideal and you don't change it, then you'll be like, oh no, now everything's all, you know, confused and my brain's messed up, especially if your brain's a bit small and slow like mine is, right? Yeah, parts, that's much better, right? Because now we can say stars. Now, a star does not actually mean a literal star in a regular expression. Star is a lot like plus. It's something that says how many of the previous token do you want? But we say no, we actually want a star. So remember, backslash is something that you can add to something that would normally be a special character class and make it not special. Actually, we don't just want stars, do we? We actually want, is that right? Yeah, well, there's a sign as well. Okay, so we shouldn't call them stars. We should call them symbols. Yeah. Symbols. And so I think the Advent of Code question defines them not by what they are, but by what they're not, which is actually great. already learnt this for a set. And so you might remember in math there's something called the complement of a set. The complement of a set is everything not in that set. So they were defined as being anything that is not a digit and not a full stop. And so let's use our shorthand. Instead of writing square brackets 0 to 9, we're like, oh no, we could just do that. So the complement of a set is caret. So this now means everything not in this set. out everything that's not in the set would be too hard, so let's just write it as not the complement of the set, not zero to nine, and not a full stop. Do you need a backslash on the full stop? You do not, because it's inside square brackets. Okay. But, you know, absolutely no harm, so you don't have to know. Full stop is a special character class, meaning anything at all. regular expression, which is why Yaku wanted us to be a bit careful of how we dealt with that. Okay, so then we're going to look for all of the sims. That won't quite work yet, because we don't have sim. That's fine, we'll just let it be wrong. We'll go back here, change that to sim, and then run all below. Okay, and not a great row to be testing on. So let's do, let's do row 8, because it's got two things on it. Row equals m8, never assume you get anything right, always write it immediately afterwards, otherwise the one time you don't, it'll be broken. Okay, so we found our symbols, right, so like don't spend time thinking, just use what you've done. So we don't want parts anymore, we want symbols. And so we've got our symbols, that's good. And so then we just did this, right? So copy, paste, star map, sims. Okay. So now we could say def. We want to return two things. Let's do them separately. I guess we'll be a bit lazy about this. It's always good. Copy, paste. So symbols. Okay. And parts. I always like to line things up so I can see more clearly I sort of messed something up. And this is the kind of thing that almost no automatic code formatter will use, which will do, which is why I never use an automatic code formatter. I always like to do things as clearly as possible for a human, even if that means typing an extra space myself manually. So then let's return the parts and the symbols. And so now we can say, parts comma symbols equals pars our matrix. Check the parts. So, you know, I'm really slow, right? I just check everything as I go. But like, if the thing was originally presented to us like this, we'd probably not find it particularly difficult, right? You'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense. all in the format that we want at this point. All right, so then always nice to just keep reminding yourself what the problem looks like. Cool. So we want to know which parts are adjacent to a symbol. So, let's pick a part and a symbol. Look at them. Because our brains are pretty good at dealing with single things, right? Is this symbol adjacent to this part? very suspicious about this. I think our symbols are wrong. Are they? Yes, they are. They're always y equals 0. Ah, also here, y equals 0. So I made the mistake. I printed things out as I went, but I didn't bother to read them. Cool. And you can see why, right? y equals 0. So let's fix those two things. So we want parts. Y equals row. Y equals Y, rather. Okay, and then symbols. Y equals Y. And then something I like to do a lot is to say clear and run all. And that's more like it. Cool. All right. So let's see. y equals 1 is adjacent to y equals 0. So that makes it look like they're next to each other there. This goes from 0 to 2. And this is 3. So yeah, it looks like it is. And yeah, it is. All right. So I could basically say like, right, OK. You know, this is the kind of thing I'm always like, well, I don't know. I can type it, I suppose. Or particularly because I can kind of type it in a nice way, right? I basically want to make sure that p.x1, let's think about this. We want to make sure that the symbol x has to be greater than p.x1. or equal to, and that one there is minus one because it can be diagonal, right? So it's got to be less than that. And then the symbol.x has to be less than or equal to the parts x2 plus one. And again this is where it's nice that we kind of fixed up those edges as we went, so it's more symmetrical and I don't know if you've seen this before, but this is one of these things that might be a bit easier if we did that. This is quite a common pattern in Python. This means that this is between these two numbers. Okay, so we want it to be between those two numbers. And we also want the parts y minus 1 to be within the bounds for the y. So like if it's not nice and symmetrical it's always useful to think about y, right. So this one, this one should be true, and it is. Okay, so that's nice. So add a copy and we'll say def And then I'd say is, I always like to like use is for my notation for things that are kind of like is something true. So is adjacent. Is this part adjacent to this symbol? And because I use the same things in my parameters, I don't have to worry here about changing anything else. So I won't accidentally have a bug there. So then I'll say is adjacent. I mean, look, obviously this should work. It's the same code, but I still run it just because I'm that anal. Okay, cool. So hopefully you can see why this is quite nice, right? Because all I need to do is go through, to know whether it has a symbol next to it, is to go through all the symbols and see if it's adjacent to my part, right? So remember, I've got my symbols. There they are. And so I want to go through all of them and see if they're adjacent to my part. Now that's interesting because again, we want the more varying thing to come first. Because it just makes life easier. Because now we can just say, oh yeah, let's go through all the symbols. And for each one, going to see if it's adjacent to my part. Let's see, so I've gone through all my symbols. Check if it's adjacent. So my symbol comes in first. Rerun. Oh, symbols.map p equals p. My bad. There we go. So yeah, the first one's adjacent. And so we can now say, has adjacency, right? Does, um, part have any adjacency has adjacency for my part. And I want to check it has an adjacency if any of these are true, right? one does have an adjacency. And so which ones do we want to keep? We want to keep the ones which do have an adjacency. They said sum up all of the… I always forget. Sum up all the part numbers, and a part is something that is next to a symbol. let's go through then, and we'll see, let's go through all of our parts. So make sure we know what they look like. So there's all of our parts. Parts. Okay, filter. All of those that have an adjacency. And kind of when you write this out, It should sound a lot like English, right? Go through the parts, filter out to find the ones that have an adjacency. Should there be eight of them? I think there was, right? Yeah, there's only two that aren't. Okay, go through all the parts that have an adjacency and sum them up. Okay, getting pretty close. wrong there. Oh right, we didn't want to sum up their d attributes. Okay, so to grab all of their d attributes there's a thing in Python's data library called attrGetter which grabs all of something with an attribute. And so in this thing we have something called attrGot. We want to grab all of the d's. Okay, so there's the d from everyone. So go through parts, find out the ones with the adjacency, grab their D attributes and sum them up. Okay, getting better. This one here we've called symbols but we didn't actually pass it in, so let's pass it in. That's important. Okay, which means this one we now need to add How's that looking, Yaku? 4361. Cool. So I got the right answer. So that's kind of what you want to see. It's like if we have a bug, we don't have to look through 50 lines of code, you know. We just look at one at a time. It also helps in like when we switch to the input. if you have a bug, you know, you can kind of do it in much smaller pieces as well. I don't remember, I think we already grabbed the input, right, in our template. Yes, we did, cool. So all we need to do now is basically go through and see what we did. So we went, okay, we did m equals sample dot split lines. Copy, paste. Oh yeah, we did parse, didn't we? So then we did parse. Let's find that. Parse. Cool. So copy, paste. And I think that's basically it. Then we did this one here. And then that becomes imp. Okay. Submit. All right. 544664. There we go. 544664. So I'm going to wrap it up there. We've got one more part. But the reason I want to wrap it up there is the exercise I want you all to go through is to replicate that style, and then part B of the puzzle, can you do it in the same way? And it should be like very small, you know, because you've got basically the parser already, the idea of adjacency already. So, you know, have a go at that. Yeah, cool. Any thoughts before we wrap up, Jaakko? No, I think my only thoughts is Even myself, I've been programming for quite a while, been adopting the style a little bit more. How's it going? I mean, I imagine it's a bit of rethinking required because you're a very experienced programmer. Yeah, I think there is a bit of rethinking and sometimes it can feel like a bit slower, but it's one of those things. It's like go slow to go fast. And I see... some other solutions. The thing I like about it is I'd like to come back to it six months from now, and I think I'd still be able to read all those little functions easily and see all that. And you can run an experiment with them. Yeah, exactly. Which is something that's very often not true of bad code. Also, you might have forgotten how find itter works by then. I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't because you know it, but people were less experienced with it. And now it's there, because you could be like, oh, why did the y-ness 1 there? It's like, oh, you can see, oh, it's more consistent this way. Yeah, exactly. So I think that sort of self-documenting nature is very handy. And some things work better with loops and an imperative style, and we'll come across those soon enough. You know, this is just a case of having more tools in your toolkit. And you can see also the way we're modifying our tools to work in a way. So a lot of tools in Python 3, they changed from 2 to 3 to make it more focused on speed rather than working well on a REPL. So for things which is nearly always we don't care about speed, you only care about speed in the inner loop of a thing that is slower than you need it to be. So in those cases, fine, you might need to go back and use some of Python 3's approaches, but we're modifying things to work the way we want them to in this interactive environment because we want to interact with them constantly. So I think that's something people don't do enough of, I find, is modifying stuff so it works in a way that's convenient. And I think the other thing that's really nice about this approach is it's unlike a Java or something where the thing that you're modifying might be like three classes over And so you're constantly having to jump all over the place and you modify something here and that then has a knock-on effect, which on the third file that you weren't really thinking about, now it's like everything here is like in the one context, which I think you can really appreciate. And Yaku, I don't think I've talked to this with you before. So what's your relationship with regular expressions? Are you in the... oh, they're useful, we'll reach them, but I have to, but they're such a pain, or are you in the like, oh, I dream about them, or where are you in the regular expression? I definitely don't dream about them too often, but I do like them just because, yeah, like I've used them enough that they're kind of relatively getting easy. So you will have experienced this thing, though, of a lot of folks bet some of your colleagues actively avoid them or be like, no, don't use that, too confusing. Yeah. And I think what we often do at work, if it's a particularly, like there are many parts to the regular expression as we'll document, like, okay, like the first part's doing this, it's like have a doc string beneath it even for yourself like coming back to it a while later it can just help yeah maybe we'll look at that later at some ways of documenting and splitting up regular expressions there's some neat approaches for that so i think my message for people today is if you're new to them recognize that um all you need is square brackets plus and star basically you know um Even dot, you know, dot means anything. You can create dot with square brackets, but it's easier just to have dot. And that's all you need. We'll learn about parentheses shortly as well, which is a nice little addition. But with, you know, with find iter, square brackets, including the carrot version. So a set, the complement of a set. So they're your character classes or anything at all. Yeah. Followed by star, zero or more. plus one or more gets you a really long way and there are other nice things you know as you were saying people can sometimes be a bit worried about like oh it can be slow because you've done a regex or whatever so in in this jupiter type environment something i like to do is use like the at time it um or percent time it um so that it you can very quickly just test like okay, if I have this big input, how fast is it gonna be? And you can get your ranges on like what to expect. Yeah, and regular expressions are written in C, right? So actually most regular expressions are gonna be much faster than doing something by hand in Python. If you try to get too tricky, it's possible to construct regular expressions, which are ridiculously slow. And we did see this recently with one of the Advent of Code 2024 things where people were constructing some rather hairy regular expressions causing Python to take more than two minutes to solve it and we're saying hey Jeremy solve it's broken. That's like I don't know what the nice way to say is like no man your regular expression's broken but yeah keep them simple and if they take a really long time then yeah try to split it up and simplify it or ask solve it for help. Okay so we've got a few weeks off until January the 6th or something like that. So this is a great opportunity to practice what you've been learning. You know, maybe try writing some documentation. Maybe try writing some meeting notes. Maybe try doing some things you didn't think you could do before. Maybe try doing day 25 of previous things. Maybe, you know, like pick something that's maybe, you know, learning something that you didn't feel like you understood. Like, I don't know, dynamic programming or... You know, do something that was a bit beyond you, or you've previously found menial, or you've previously been told you're not particularly good at, and try to solve it for you. And try doing stuff in Cursor, in Cloud Projects, in Colab, in whatever, and share, you know, your experiences. Because a lot of people are asking us, hey, how do we use these ideas at work, you know? where we use VS Code, or we use Zed, or we use Cursor, or we use Visual Studio, or whatever. And how do I do it in a way that fits well with my colleagues who don't use these styles? How do I work with NBDev to export things? These are all things that we need you to help us with, right? Because we've only got the experience of using this at AnswerAI. When I answer AI, we're all using it and we all use NBDev and, you know, we don't necessarily know the answers to these questions. So we would love help, share your experiences, build new tools and have a lot of fun, of course, with Shell Sage. Thanks for joining us today, Yaku. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody. And have a very Merry Christmas to those of you that celebrate it. A very excellent summer for those of us in Australia. Winter for those of you in the Northern Hemisphere. Bye. See you.\"}\n"

              "\"[00:00:06.249 -> 00:00:21.714] Okay, I think we are live. Hi everybody. Can you all hear me okay?\\n[00:01:02.338 -> 00:01:34.018] Looks like it took quite a while to start, but I think it might have started now. Let's see. Okay, we're on. Great. Sorry about that. Okay. Jono has mysteriously morphed into Nate and Yaku. I don't exactly know how that happened, but hello, Nate. Hello, Yaku. Thanks for being here. Happy to be here.\\n[00:01:34.018 -> 00:02:03.285] I want to say hi, Yaku, so your face appears. Hey everyone. Yaku is actually in Queensland, but not actually in front of that particular island display. Where's your island display from today, Yaku? It's constantly changing, I know. This particular island display is up in the Whitsundays. That's actually where they filmed Pirates of the Caribbean. Definitely recommend.\\n[00:02:03.285 -> 00:02:33.257] checking it out if you come to Australia. Yeah going sailing in the Whitsundays is one of the best experiences of my life I've got to admit. Moving on from sailing in the Whitsundays, a quick logistics notice just you should click stop Solvert in your dashboard and reconnect to make sure you've got the current version because we had a quick little fix to some new functionality we'll show today which is the duplicate button which you'll find there\\n[00:02:33.257 -> 00:03:01.705] on your server. Today, we are going to start by not using SolveIt, but by instead using something that Nate released this week after giving us all at Answer.ai the great joy of being able to use it for the last few weeks. And it's literally a life-changing experience for me. So without further ado, Nate, tell us what you\\n[00:03:01.705 -> 00:03:25.133] built and how it connects to all this Solve It bizzle? Yeah, so I created Shell Sage, which is a bit of a mouthful. The code name at Answer.ai is Bash Buddy, which is a lot easier and friendlier. But Shell Sage is an AI assistant right in your terminal.\\n[00:03:25.133 -> 00:03:40.245] and the really great thing about having a ai assistant right in your terminal is that through the power of tmux it can actually see what you're seeing and this gives it\\n[00:03:40.245 -> 00:04:05.437] the same sort of context awareness that you see when using SolveIt. So, for example, in SolveIt, when you're writing to the AI assistant, it can see all of your messages above, whether or not that's the code and the output of the code or any notes that you've written to yourself or previous messages from the AI assistant. And so it can give you context-specific information.\\n[00:04:05.437 -> 00:04:34.278] answers that you wouldn't be able to get if you were, say, copying and pasting your code and stuff into, say, ChatGPT or copying and pasting outputs from a terminal into ChatGPT. And I think what happened is, like a lot of us at AnswerAI now, when we use an archaic system which is not connected\\n[00:04:34.645 -> 00:05:03.549] like directly seeing what we're working on and connected with an AI, it feels hopelessly obsolete. And so, you know, when we were working in bash on our server, for example, it felt ridiculous to have to do things myself or have to tell an AI what I'm doing and what happened. And so you've basically bought all that to, to the terminal and, oh dear, somebody in the chat, uh, Justin Hong might have to be banned for bad punning.\\n[00:05:03.549 -> 00:05:26.313] Just like humans, shells age. He put the space in before that. That is just terrible. So, dear. So why don't you, what are you going to give us a demo so we can see it live? Great. I also want to make a quick shout out to to\\n[00:05:26.313 -> 00:05:54.850] Richard Rees in the Discord. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Actually, I'm going to be going through this one shortly. So he's going to get a big shout out. OK, great. Yeah. OK, great. Yes. So if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, which is great. And we're actually going to do the first step anyways on a new server. So let me go ahead and swap over to that. So I've been teaching the AnswerAI Team System Administration in recent weeks. And we've actually been using Shell Sage as\\n[00:05:54.850 -> 00:06:23.690] part of that. So everybody now has their own little server that they have launched, a nice fresh server that we used OpenStack to launch automatically from the command line. So I guess this is your fresh new server, Nate. Yes. And it's called Sadmin because I always have issues when it comes to system administration, but Shell Sage is turning that around. So this is a very bare bones installation of Ubuntu 2024.\\n[00:06:24.169 -> 00:06:52.105] and the only real sort of package that i've added to it is conda so that i can install shellfish this service costing you six dollars a month i believe so yeah we went for the extra two gigabytes of ram we're big ballers here at answer um and so one thing that's really nice with shell sage is you can also use it to bootstrap so if you don't have tmux or anything installed you can also\\n[00:06:52.105 -> 00:07:20.577] get shell sage to help you out with getting all of that set up. So I can do pip install shell sage to get the most recent version. And we're basically in business. I can type s sage to invoke shell sage. And since I don't have tmux installed, if I were to try and ask it a question, it will first generate an error, which will be fixed in a future version very soon. But if I don't want that,\\n[00:07:20.577 -> 00:07:51.589] I just have to do dash dash nh, which stands for no history. Basically, don't use tmux. And just a question from the audience here about what kind of computer is this we're logging into. This is from a company called Genesis Hosting. Genesis Hosting, like a lot of folks, uses an open standard called OpenStack, which is really nice. So by using an OpenStack provider, we're able to basically use the same scripts and processes across all the providers we want.\\n[00:07:51.589 -> 00:08:22.437] Yeah, think about it as like AWS's CLI or GCPs, but actually it's Fain. And open. And open, yes. So let's go ahead and see how to install Tmux. So Tmux is, you're going to be telling us more about it for now, though suffice to say it's something that SalesAge needs in order to provide the context understanding of what you've typed recently and what answers you've got back recently.\\n[00:08:22.437 -> 00:08:37.417] Yeah. And as you can see, it gives me a few options. So I know that I'm on a Debian slash Ubuntu server, so I'm going to use the apt install version. And then it says I can launch tmux by just invoking the command afterwards.\\n[00:08:37.417 -> 00:09:04.117] And also I can use a man tmux to get some information about what tmux is. So we'll go ahead and do that. There's no history as in you're saying I don't have tmux installed. So we'll probably remove the need for that pretty soon. It'll check for itself where the tmux is there and maybe give you a warning. Yeah. Isaac gave a really cool way of doing that. So we'll be pushing a new version shortly.\\n[00:09:04.117 -> 00:09:33.049] All right, so I installed that. I'll go ahead and just open up Tmux's man pages by typing the other command that Shell Sage provided. And so here is basically the actual documentation behind Tmux. It stands for a terminal multiplexer, and it just basically enables creating sessions and managing different types of,\\n[00:09:33.049 -> 00:09:47.794] like shell environments in a single window in a really clean and easy way. And it's very popular among system administrators. And so we can go ahead and\\n[00:09:48.225 -> 00:10:14.326] read through this documentation, but we have Shell Sage, so we can use Shell Sage to help us out here. Let's go ahead and launch TMUX. As you can see, some stuff just changed a little bit. I now am in like a fresh new environment. I also have this bar at the bottom that's green that has some information on it. And in the bottom here, you have information about the session you were in.\\n[00:10:14.729 -> 00:10:44.546] You don't really have to worry about it. We at Answer just usually use one session. And then within that session, we'll use some other stuff like windows or panes, which I'll show you shortly, to have different working areas. And so now let's go ahead and ask Shel Sage, how do I use, to give you a bit of a understanding of how TMux sort of works.\\n[00:10:44.546 -> 00:11:11.061] Oh, my goodness. Oh, I just... Shell Sage likely knows me a little bit too well. I will just mention something, though, about chatting to language models, which is because they are autoregressive, they've learnt by completing sentences. This might seem surprising, but actually they work better if you type\\n[00:11:11.061 -> 00:11:41.602] grammatically correctly, use correct capitalization, you know, that kind of thing. The reinforcement learning phase we talked about last time does help them to answer correctly, even when you say, who do TMUX? But, you know, it's actually worth spending time. We could, you know, it'd be probably, maybe we should add a little grammar and capitalization fixer or something to solve it at some point, but we don't currently have that. So it is definitely worth spending time\\n[00:11:41.602 -> 00:11:56.553] trying to type things carefully to get better answers. Yes, I totally agree. Luckily, Shell Sage was able to understand me in this instance. So it gives me a little bit of information on what are the main things\\n[00:11:56.553 -> 00:12:19.221] do with tmux as you can see there's this control b which is kind of like entering command mode in tmux and then you have some next sort of key press that will trigger an event for example if i want to create a new window i can do control b c and now i've created a new working space\\n[00:12:19.221 -> 00:12:48.969] session, or window in this case, where I can run commands that is separate from the one that I was just in. So let's try to focus here on the bit that I reckon everybody ought to know, which I reckon you don't need to know this, I would hit Ctrl D to close this one, and to go back to the original one. And then I would show focus on the split panes, because that's what like, I think everybody probably wants to know how to do. And then with Ctrl B, Z, that is going to\\n[00:12:48.969 -> 00:13:11.913] really get people uh optimizing their their team the workflows makes sense yeah so um one of the best things if you want to make all of your non-tech friends think you're a hacker is to split your pain into multiple different session into different uh into different pains so control b will uh with uh with the\\n[00:13:11.913 -> 00:13:41.221] double quotes, we'll do it horizontally. And then with the percent sign, we'll do a vertical split. And then to navigate around, I can use Control-B and then the arrow key. So if I want to go back to the main one, I can Control-B up. And now I am in the top one. And all of these are separate, so they don't conflict with each other or anything like that. So can you show Control-B-Z in that one so that I can maximize that pane?\\n[00:13:41.221 -> 00:14:11.369] Yeah, so Control-P-Z basically zooms into a particular pane to make it full screen. And now this is super useful if you've done a lot of outputs and you want to zoom into a particular one to focus on doing some specific task. And then if you want to go back to the multi-pane view, you just do Control-B-Z again, and you're back into the multi-pane example here.\\n[00:14:11.369 -> 00:14:36.974] So the only other ones I would show you perhaps before we jump into Shell Sage would be Control-B-D and Tmux-A because Control-B-D is very nice because it means that you can reboot your computer, go away, come back tomorrow and come back to exactly where you left it, including Jupyter server running, long running training jobs, et cetera.\\n[00:14:38.621 -> 00:15:07.881] Yeah, so if any of y'all have suffered from SSHing into a server, running something, and then your SSH connection drops or something like that, and you realize that your long-running training job was killed because of it, TMUX is something that you should definitely look into because of this ability to detach and have sessions always going on. So if I do this Control-B-D, I have detached\\n[00:15:07.881 -> 00:15:34.653] from the tmux session. And now I'm back into my original terminal shell environment before I launched the tmux command. So you can see all of the history is still here and even the commands that I ran. And if I do something like tmux ls, you can see the existing sessions that are currently available in the tmux server.\\n[00:15:34.653 -> 00:15:58.537] So I have this session 0 that has one window. And if I want to reattach back to it, I would just type in tmux a. And that gets me back into whatever state that I was running in. Any long running commands that I was running here would still be going on without interruption, which is super useful. And a quick question from the chat about\\n[00:15:58.537 -> 00:16:27.342] Authenticating. So you do need an API key from anthropic for this, we will be adding other LM providers as well. But for now, you need to set the anthropic API key environment variable, which if it's not currently mentioned in the Readme, we will make sure it's added to it. Yes. All right, let's use it. Awesome. Okay, so I have a problem with my server. Shall we\\n[00:16:28.137 -> 00:17:10.069] Let's do it. Control-B-Z. And so I have a problem with this server. I have unfortunately put in a lot of data, and so my space is getting limited. So I need to get Shell Sage to kind of find out where in my file system I have my largest files so that I can clean them up. So let's go ahead and ask Shell Sage.\\n[00:17:10.069 -> 00:17:39.753] And this is a place that also voice can work pretty well. Yes, something like transcription with WhisperFlow. We can showcase that in a second as well. But here we can see that Shell Sage has recommended using the sudo du command with a dash ah flag. And it's piping it through a bunch of stuff. But it also gives us exclamation points.\\n[00:17:39.753 -> 00:18:09.061] explainer for each one of these. So in this case, it's running it with elevated privileges because it's trying to do it on the root, which you can do. But in this case, it's going to probably take a little bit too long for this demo. So we'll change that in a second. And then it's using this du command. So this stands for disk usage. And it's just formatting it for us a little bit. And then it'll pipe that and sort it by the top\\n[00:18:09.061 -> 00:18:39.101] files and folder usages. So let's go ahead and run this. It actually even gives a quicker result, one for my home directory, which is actually what I want. It even gives me a little warning here that it might take a large time on large systems. Great. Thank you very much, Shell Sage. Okay. It looks like the problem seems to be in my data. Don't tell us. Have it tell us. Okay.\\n[00:18:39.101 -> 00:19:08.169] All right. Let's see. So let me do it with some voice. Great. I ran the commands. Now what? So it sees the output as well as the history of input. That's the really cool thing about Shell Sage. Yeah. So as you can see, analyzing the output, it's able to tell that\\n[00:19:08.169 -> 00:19:34.189] Oh, interesting. It hasn't actually used the output very well. Yeah, and it is able to navigate, investigate specific directories. So it does know that it is in home Ubuntu data. But I would have said my request would have been more specific than yours, I would have said something like, Oh, what do you see in this output, or something like this, I think it's quite useful to try and\\n[00:19:34.189 -> 00:19:56.994] Again, like try and be the human in the driving seat, not just for SolveIt, but also for Shell Sage. I find it works better if I really try to drive towards the answer I'm looking for. Yeah, I agree. Do you think we should give it a little bit more hints or should we? Yeah, why don't you say like, you know, what do you see in these results or something like that?\\n[00:20:17.826 -> 00:20:41.929] Great. OK, now this is way more specific. I like it. It even gives me the numbers. So it's saying that there seems to be a lot of large video files that are taking up the space, along with some image files. And it even recommends some actions. Oh, also repository with a large Miniconda installation that I probably should clean up.\\n[00:20:41.929 -> 00:21:11.765] I can investigate further for this particular directory that seems to be taking up the most space. But let's go ahead and give it a little bit more information on what exactly I want to clean up. Just before you do, I'm going to answer a question from the chat, if that's OK. So Thomas asks, if you type in your pseudo password, will it be passed to the LLM? Now the answer is no, but I want to explain why it's no. Solve it.\\n[00:21:11.765 -> 00:21:42.633] And Shell Sage work exactly the same way, which is that the thing that's passed to the LLM, the information that's passed to the LLM, is the information you see on your screen. So in SolveIt, everything above the current message is sent as you see it, along with context, if you've added that. And here, everything in Tmux is sent. So, Nate, can you just do a control B left square bracket? So control B left square bracket puts you in scroll mode. And then if you press page up a couple of times,\\n[00:21:42.633 -> 00:22:13.609] You use PageUp? Oh, PageUp. You don't have that on your keyboard? There's PageUp on my keyboard. Should be function up, otherwise. Well, how do you survive without PageUp? There you go. OK. So as you can see, Tmux has been keeping track of all the input and output. And so that's exactly what will be sent. So you won't see the pseudo password there. And so if you don't see it there, Claude's not going to see it either.\\n[00:22:13.609 -> 00:22:43.817] Um, okay, so let's give it a little bit more of a challenge and let's say that I want to clean up all of the files that are above, um, 300 megabytes. Okay. I want to clean up all of the files in the data directory that are above 300 megabytes. How do I do that? Look good.\\n[00:22:43.817 -> 00:23:12.629] Great. Awesome. It's interesting to see because my recommendation would be to look at them first. I'd be interested to see if Shell Sage makes that recommendation as well. Because if you've got like, you know, grandma's 95th birthday, do not delete.mp4. You probably want to know that. Yeah, there you go. It is. So. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And also it is moving them. Yeah. Yeah.\\n[00:23:12.629 -> 00:23:42.397] And so I can also do it with RM and what's even greater is that it uses the proper, you should be using dash I so that you have to confirm whether or not you want those files actually deleted. And it breaks down each one of the bits. So I can also list the files here and make sure that this command is actually gonna do what I want it to do. That one looks good.\\n[00:23:42.397 -> 00:24:17.821] And I'm going to go ahead and delete these because I know that these are not grandma's old home video footages, luckily. And I'm going to go ahead and say, or I'll go ahead and confirm with Shell Sage, does this look right to you? Of course, they won't really know if those are videos you want to keep, but maybe at all. That's true. Let's see what it'll say.\\n[00:24:17.821 -> 00:24:48.593] And yeah, asked me to consider the different options. So that's great. Yes, I've considered them. Thank you very much. It really wants me to back them up. Its recommendation to gzip them is actually terrible, which is interesting. So remember, these things are not always great. Gziping a MP4 won't make it any smaller at all. Oh, interesting. Good call out. And as you can see with the dash i flag, I have to confirm. I wonder why.\\n[00:24:48.593 -> 00:25:06.181] I feel like yeah I think piping into uh rm minus i might not work okay again we've got some minor issues but anyway I think that's enough probably to get started right yeah is there anything else you wanted to talk about shell sage before we\\n[00:25:06.181 -> 00:25:35.145] Move on. Just check out the repo if you have any cool ideas. Also chat about it in the Discord. I've been loving the energy and stuff like that that people have been sharing their experiences and feature requests and stuff like that. I know everyone wants to be able to use other models, so that is a top priority to get in. And feel free to also contribute as well. PRs are welcome. And probably the kind of\\n[00:25:35.145 -> 00:26:02.185] amount of energy required to get started contributing to ShellSAGE would be way lower than almost any other project you've come across because Nate's designed it in a really clever way. So it's very concise, so it's very easy to work with and understand and it's also early days so it's very small. Also at Answer.ai we tend to value lower complexity more importantly than we value, you know,\\n[00:26:02.185 -> 00:26:31.061] A lot of the kind of enterprise style software development so it's like much easier to read and work with so yeah anybody who's interested in like contributing to open source, for the first time. This is probably a good opportunity to do so, and you can do it, you know you can use solve it or notebooks or collab or you know stuff like that to try and do it in a more. solve it friendly way practice what you've been learning.\\n[00:26:31.061 -> 00:27:00.493] Yeah, and also Nate's very helpful and patient. So if you're not sure how to do those things, and there's also the community on the Solve-It channel that's on the Solve, sorry, the Shell Sage channel on the Solve-It server. He can help you. Yeah, I guess one other shout out is that there was a change, and so I'll be hosting the office hours after the class today. With Yaku, I think. Okay, thank you, Nate.\\n[00:27:00.493 -> 00:27:31.061] I will leave you to keep an eye on admin stuff that's happening. Thank you for joining us today. Great pleasure. Everyone see you on the discord. Okay. And then Yaku. Hello. I think we're now going to move to another non solvent thing, which is a specific kind of application area of\\n[00:27:31.061 -> 00:27:59.677] the Solve-It style approach, which at Answer AI, we've been using a lot over recent months and it came up with you during an office hours you were running. So maybe, yeah, tell us about, you know, this idea, I guess you helped out somebody with, with something they asked about. But afterwards I kind of said to you, oh, maybe we should focus actually on teaching people how they can learn themselves. Yeah. So what came up during the office hours was that\\n[00:27:59.677 -> 00:28:28.613] one of the students was looking to learn about generators. And he sort of said that he'd read the docs. Hang on, decorators, right? Say again? Decorators, not generators? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant to say. So Freudian slip if that came out wrong. So yes, decorators. And yeah, he was having trouble understanding it.\\n[00:28:28.613 -> 00:28:58.849] And he just asked if we could go through that. And so we did do a little bit of a solvent explanation, but yeah, as Jeremy said, we probably could have done a better demonstration of how to do that yourself. So that's what we're gonna do today. All right, let's do it. All right. So what I wanna\\n[00:28:58.849 -> 00:29:30.269] learn something from Solve It. We're going to assume that we have very limited knowledge today. We're quite new to even Python itself. And we want to learn about decorators. So we're learning something new and quite early. So I'm just going to start off with a prompt.\\n[00:29:30.269 -> 00:29:59.370] So you're a typer as well, Yaku, or do you use voice input sometimes? I've started using the voice input, but currently Alfred and... Here, I'll show you. See, it's conflicting with the Super Whisper. I need to fix that still. So I'm trying to learn about decorators. I've read the docs, but I just don't get it.\\n[00:30:00.290 -> 00:30:29.837] So kind of treating this like it's Jeremy and I have my own personal Jeremy and I can ask him questions. I don't have to just watch the videos anymore. I can now actually ask him questions. So, hey, I'm trying to learn about, I read the docs, but I just don't get it. Can you show me some examples? So I wouldn't start there.\\n[00:30:29.837 -> 00:30:58.229] Let's talk about how best to get the most out of this. Luckily, it's helping you a bit. When you're getting help here, it does help to understand some basic ideas about how best to learn and how best to do education to help solve it, help you. Rather than jumping into examples, you can see here it's asking us some questions.\\n[00:30:58.229 -> 00:31:29.109] I would start out by saying like, I don't know what, what do you mean functions that take other functions and what that, what's that got to do with decorators or something? Because actually we need to start out by understanding. So I would have started out by saying like, hey, what, what's the basic idea? Can you give me an overview? Okay. Or we can change it. No, don't change it. Let's keep going. Let's go. This is great. We can just cancel. And I would answer question two and say, yeah. Okay.\\n[00:31:29.109 -> 00:31:59.938] Yeah I get functions. Okay so again like let's try to be careful about how we type these things because the better we type the better the kind of better the autoregressive mode is going to get in. So let's say you know use capitalization, say yes, add a comma. It makes a really big difference to the responses we're going to get. Okay. Comma I am comfortable with Python functions.\\n[00:31:59.938 -> 00:32:31.125] And that's another good reason to get voice working is it tends to give you better constructed sentences. Yep.\\n[00:32:31.125 -> 00:33:01.093] So let's start by understanding functions as an argument. This is a key part of decorators. OK. Function can be treated like any other object. So you can assign them to variables. Here's a simple example to try. Would you like me to show you a basic example of passing a function as an argument? Would you prefer to try writing yourself?\\n[00:33:01.093 -> 00:33:30.494] Yeah, I would say, I don't know how to do it. Can you show me? Sure. You just say yes then. And you can press command enter to submit or control enter. Okay. Um, so here's a simple example. So we've defined a function, say hello.\\n[00:33:31.637 -> 00:33:59.158] And we've defined something called apply greeting, which takes a function and a name, and then it's going to call that function with the name. So when we have apply greeting, and then we're going to use it by putting in the say hello function and passing it Alice as the name. Okay, so let's try it.\\n[00:33:59.573 -> 00:34:28.857] So let me just explain how that works to people. So it's like it's not very straightforward. Yeah, go ahead and submit it. I like the way you use the copy up to code there. So in the apply greeting function, the way to think of it is that where it says func in def apply greeting func, that func is going to be replaced with whatever you send it. So we're sending it say hello. So instead of saying func, it will be say hello.\\n[00:34:28.857 -> 00:35:04.361] And name will be replaced with Alice. So it's going to actually return the result of calling sayHello Alice. And this is literally what functions do. In fact, math is basically replacing symbols with other symbols according to rules, as is computer science. And so when you kind of do it that way, you can work through it in your head to see exactly what's going on. I guess we should ask what on earth this has got to do with decorators, should we? Sure.\\n[00:35:04.361 -> 00:35:34.338] So decorate is a special way to use this concept. It's a function that takes another function and returns a modified version. So let's build on this example.\\n[00:35:34.338 -> 00:36:03.882] So here's the same idea written as a decorator. So we've got this at greeting decorator function. And then there's another def inside of it. So I haven't seen that before. It's kind of interesting. It's a def inside of a def. So I'll ask about that in a second. And then let's put this at on top of\\n[00:36:04.706 -> 00:36:34.793] get name, which we didn't have a get name before. So it seems like it's a slightly different example. Yeah. So maybe we should start then by looking at the, it's just a shorter way of writing colon. So maybe let's copy the bottom line that it's got the ad greeting decors. Yeah. So if you copy that by going to the far right and clicking on the copy button and then press Apple V and then we should try it.\\n[00:36:34.793 -> 00:37:04.301] Because that's what we do. But we haven't defined this stuff yet. That's true. So prompt. Yes, no worries. So let's click on the previous one to modify it. I can delete it. That's fine. Yeah, OK, you're right. So let's do it a different way. So let's delete the previous one. Get rid of it. OK.\\n[00:37:04.301 -> 00:37:33.410] delete it. And instead we can modify it. So yes, click delete. And this is actually a useful thing to show people how this actually works. It doesn't want to delete. So let's change. So scroll up so that we can see that. Yeah. Click on the copy this to output button here. Yeah. And we'll see what it actually does is it copies in all of the bits, all of the code, which is quite cool. And so if we just delete the ad greeting decorator and the print, then\\n[00:37:33.410 -> 00:38:00.842] Get rid of that get name, get rid of the print, everything except get rid of the get name. There we go. That's what we want. Get name is not defined. Oh, it's get name we wanted, not add greeting decorator that we wanted. Yeah. So we'll copy this. But not with the decorator. There we go. Sorry about that, Jaco. That's all right.\\n[00:38:05.749 -> 00:38:34.554] Oh, so now we should try it. Oh, what the hell? Yeah, we've come out, got this in a bit of a broken state, haven't we? Yeah, oops. Okay, back to this. Nice. Okay, so yeah, now we've got name is Alice, yeah. Okay. And then...\\n[00:38:36.605 -> 00:39:06.261] We actually wanted the get name equals at greeting decorator. Oh, it's a bit annoying because it's giving it the same name as what we started with. So what if you selected it and made the def called underscore get name, you know, and then get name equals get. Yeah, so we want the whole thing. We just want to do it without the decorator to start with.\\n[00:39:06.261 -> 00:39:35.074] Okay, I modified to do it without the decorator. So to do it without the decorator. So you delete that. Yeah. And then you use change get name to underscore get name. And then copy their last line of code, which says get name equals at greeting decorator into your output. And then change that.\\n[00:39:35.074 -> 00:40:05.954] last get name to underscore get name. Yep. Yeah. So it's kind of like, yeah, trying to get this to actually demonstrate it. It went too many steps ahead. Um, so this is where we kind of got to be a bit careful about that. I guess the educational approach of these things, they, they often jumped too many steps ahead. So now you should be able to call get name.\\n[00:40:05.954 -> 00:40:30.458] And we put in a name that we want. So we add Alice. And, okay, so it came back as hello Alice. And our underscore get name returns name. Okay. And then get name returned a function.\\n[00:40:34.018 -> 00:41:03.938] AddGradingDecorator returned a function. Yes. Returned this new function wrapper that we defined that where wrapper takes in name and then is returning this is an f string so it's going to execute inside of it. So personally what I would do at this point if I didn't\\n[00:41:03.938 -> 00:41:09.502] fully understand it was be like, Hey, can you break this down line by line? That's happening.\\n[00:41:45.865 -> 00:42:16.341] Okay. So, I mean, the goal of this isn't to learn about decorators. It's just to kind of walk through the pros and cons of the approach. I think this is useful, right? So we can see, like, in order to learn stuff with SolveIt, we have to be quite intentional. And, you know, you really want to, like, try every example. And anytime there's an example you don't understand, you've got to, like,\\n[00:42:16.341 -> 00:42:46.082] asking, you know, and keep going into smaller and smaller pieces. And if it tries to go too far ahead, you've got to try to rewind and kind of go through it more, you know, more slowly. So I think something that would be really useful in the office hours, you know, is if there's ideas, you know, libraries, APIs, computer science techniques, anything else that you've had trouble learning, you know, bring them to the office hours or a study group.\\n[00:42:46.082 -> 00:43:16.261] and work through them, you know, and say like, here's me trying to learn about it. Here's me trying to ask the question. And in the office hours, we might try to really focus on, you know, teaching people how to fish rather than doing the fishing for them, if that makes sense. There's a question in the chat about like, should you delete portions of the conversation if it goes too far off track?\\n[00:43:16.261 -> 00:43:40.898] I'd say yes, definitely you should, right? If the dialogue's not going in a direction you're happy with, because of the way the language model's trained, it will want to continue to go on in a direction that's not very good. Because in the past, documents it's been trained on, things that tended to go badly, keep going badly. So instead, modify one of its outputs to say what you would wish it had said.\\n[00:43:40.898 -> 00:44:10.217] you know, or just delete everything from the point at which you kind of felt like it wasn't going great and try again. It's really important to understand how these language models are trained in order to get the most out of them. What do you think, Yaku? Um, yep. I think, well, I guess we've kind of shown the concepts here of learning. Did you want to keep going or...? No, no, I'm just, yeah.\\n[00:44:10.217 -> 00:44:40.194] to get your comments or your thoughts on the process basically. So yeah I guess let's see how we go after. So after class today there'll be another office hours and maybe folks can join in and you guys can try this out. Nate will be there too right? Yeah yeah for sure he will be there and yeah we can try that then. Okay super. I've got some more examples of this kind of thing I can show if people are interested. And for these examples I'm going to show a new tool\\n[00:44:40.194 -> 00:45:12.610] which I really like. And the tool I want to show is something in Claude called projects. So projects\\n[00:45:12.610 -> 00:45:40.722] Here's an example. Projects have a few things in them. One is just you can add a system prompt. So when I was kind of experimenting with teaching kids calculus, I just added a system prompt. So that's kind of the most basic starting point. And then you can see, you know,\\n[00:45:43.234 -> 00:46:13.634] doing calculus. And one nice thing in Claude is that it can output artifacts, which are fun. And so we kind of used that to kind of ask for examples. And I was trying to help the kids kind of get a sense for the basic ideas behind calculus. The more interesting part, however,\\n[00:46:13.634 -> 00:46:41.030] is that you can add context. Now Discord, I was creating a Discord helper which would let me right click on something in Discord and choose get message link.\\n[00:46:41.781 -> 00:47:06.581] it would basically create a bookmark of that message that I could look up and jump to later. I had never used Discord API before so I basically grabbed all of the documentation that I thought might be necessary and turned them into markdown files. So let's just have a quick look example of that. Often it's quite difficult to kind of\\n[00:47:06.581 -> 00:47:36.258] scrape documentation. Often it uses JavaScript. It often has like, like Google's ones have some kind of bot detection. I don't know why you'd do that because it's really good to have bots using it. But a really good way to do this is if you right click on docs, choose inspect. And then if you press left arrow until you can see basically the entire area that you want is selected like so. And then you can just say copy out of HTML.\\n[00:47:36.258 -> 00:48:05.346] And then I created this thing called web2md.answer.ai that you can paste that into. And underneath, you can see it's turned into Markdown. And then what I normally do is I then click on gist it. Right, and we now have\\n[00:48:06.197 -> 00:48:34.389] a gist that contains that documentation. We should have given it a markdown name so it would actually appear as markdown. There we go. And then what I do is I then add that to my Claude project. And so you can see there they all are, right? And so with this, and then I added a system prompt,\\n[00:48:34.389 -> 00:49:01.929] say like help me create a Discord app and then I would just kind of ask it basic questions like I would like to create an application in Python for Discord in which I could right click on a message in a server and it would send a link to that message to\\n[00:49:01.929 -> 00:49:32.962] a DM to me so that I could effectively bookmark it for later. Based on the documentation provided, does this sound like something that should be possible using this approach? So don't be too concise. Tell it everything you want. Give it all the information you need. And this is kind of where I started.\\n[00:49:32.962 -> 00:50:04.738] The other thing I forgot to do here, because I started doing this back before this was an issue, is I would go back to this here and I would say don't use artifacts, because they're not at all useful for Python. Save instructions. Just while we're on this screen, Jeremy, could you show quickly where the gist was useful there?\\n[00:50:04.738 -> 00:50:31.826] where the gist was useful. Actually, I guess in this case, what was important was the, well, yeah, I can show you. You could actually just paste it in. So maybe in this case, the gist wasn't necessary. You could just copy. So let's go back to the project, Discord. Yeah, so when you say add knowledge, you can either upload or add text.\\n[00:50:32.501 -> 00:51:01.858] So yeah, you actually want to either save the file locally or paste it. So I guess actually in this case, the gist wasn't so useful. Yeah, thanks for checking. So now that we've modified that to say please don't use the totally pointless artifacts, which it's really overenthusiastic about, it should give us something much more.\\n[00:51:01.858 -> 00:51:27.950] prosaic. So you can see. Where was that? Sorry. Now I've lost where I was doing it.\\n[00:51:28.597 -> 00:51:56.898] Anyway, so I used that to create that Discord thing and also to kind of document it as I went. And a similar idea, Richard created a nice tutorial here for Shell Sage using the same approach, I believe, which is adding the context to a project being the kind of existing documentation that they created.\\n[00:51:56.898 -> 00:52:25.250] And one thing that's really helpful is that in these cases, Richard exported a gist of the Claude project output. Unfortunately, there isn't something built into Claude currently to do that. But my colleague and friend, Hamel, has kindly made one. So you can go to Claude Save and get an extension that will save it in exactly this format, as you see.\\n[00:52:26.466 -> 00:52:57.250] So let me give you some tips for kind of how to create good documentation and other things you can do with this. So one thing I did was I wanted to create documentation about a library I created called Fastlight. And so I tried to make sure I asked very specific questions to be like the kinds of things that I really wanted people to know the answers to. So what does Fastlight add to SQLite Utils?\\n[00:52:57.250 -> 00:53:27.705] you know, okay, show an example of doing this, show an example of doing this. And I'm not really getting it to just write the documentation for me. I'm trying to get it to write the things that I want to kind of add to my documentation. So again, it's like pretty much a dialogue between the human and the computer, even though I'm not in Solve It here. This is one of my favorite ones. Actually, sorry, not this one.\\n[00:53:27.705 -> 00:53:55.970] This one's one of my favorite ones. One of the best books I've read for many years is this book by the guy that created HTMX and some other folks. And it's basically all about how to create web applications from a deep understanding of the fundamentals of how the web works. And I think it's amazing. And I wanted to be able to provide parts of that to both have something that humans can read, but particularly I wanted something much more concise\\n[00:53:55.970 -> 00:54:25.266] that a language model can read. So I think I've got something strange here. So let me just do it here. OK. So I don't have the original dialog I used to create this, which is silly of me. I should have kept it. But I can show you how I made it.\\n[00:54:26.402 -> 00:54:53.154] all of the first chapter of the book into context. And then I basically said like, please summarize this for me. And its first summary was crappy. And I basically kept telling it how to make it better. I'd be like, provide a lot more information, provide a lot more examples, copy things than the original. And I went through about five goes until I got one I liked. I modified it myself, editing a few things I didn't like. I then deleted everything between.\\n[00:54:53.154 -> 00:55:22.146] And so I ended up with me asking a question and it giving it a great answer. And then for chapter two, I then put chapter two plus the chapter one summary in and said, please create a summary of chapter two using the approach you see of the summary in chapter one. Here are some things particularly to look out for. So I summarized the things that got wrong last time. And the second time I only had to do it like twice to get a really good answer. And you can see like for a whole chapter, it's got,\\n[00:55:22.146 -> 00:55:50.749] an extraordinary amount of detail and examples, but it's much more concise than the book, right? So it's a really great reference. So again, I deleted the ones that I didn't like as much. And so I added up with something where the answer was exactly what I would have liked, edited it to make it even better. And then for chapter three, I then did the same thing. And then I again added the extra things that were still not quite getting right. And for chapter three, the first time it was perfect, right? And it's got all these great examples.\\n[00:55:50.749 -> 00:56:20.090] details and then so I just kept adding one chapter at a time and after a couple more goes it then did a bad one again and so this time I actually kept the bad one and I said and I and I left it in the dialogue and said no no no not like that you know look at the earlier chapters to see how to do it right here are the problems and so then chapter five again is great you know it's got all this detail and so I found I can add now this markdown of a chapter\\n[00:56:20.962 -> 00:56:49.410] to a dialogue and immediately the language model fully understands how to use HTML and HTMX really well. Let's try to see how I get the URL on the screen. Not quite sure how to do that. Sorry.\\n[00:56:49.410 -> 00:57:19.138] Just trying to get the URL on the screen as well, but it's a bit tricky. I can see it now. Okay, great. I'm just cutting off the very bottom, but hopefully you don't need the very bottom. So let me show another interesting example of this, which is something quite different, which is there's a lot of stuff out there for creating meeting notes. And to me, a meeting shouldn't happen unless\\n[00:57:19.138 -> 00:57:50.685] it's going to create some really useful output. So for me, we don't have meetings at Answer AI very often at all. And when we do, we have a really high bar for what they're proposed to do. And then so since they're meant to be really good, really useful things, then we want the artifacts from that to be really great. So the normal meeting notes you get from AI tend to be super concise and not really tell you what went on. So when I had a meeting with Hamill,\\n[00:57:50.685 -> 00:58:17.890] I pasted the whole thing into a cloud project that I use for this purpose, right? So it's like, here's my Zoom meeting. I just paste it in the full transcript. And I said to it, this is key. I said, right, rewrite this to be suitable for publishing in a magazine, right? Combine their contributions so it's less fragmented, clean it up, right?\\n[00:58:17.890 -> 00:58:46.810] Do not lose any content. This is the most important thing. Just do the first eight paragraphs. And then stop. And so then here's the entire... Oopsie-daisy. Here's the... So I've got a brand new keyboard, which was possibly a mistake to use this because it's a really strange layout. Okay. So here's the whole transcript. And then it's like, okay, here's a rewrite.\\n[00:58:48.194 -> 00:59:17.410] And it always does, you know, a pretty bad job. So I edited it. So I did a couple more versions of that and said, no, no, that wasn't right. That wasn't right. And then I kept, you know, the one that I did like. And then I said, great, go on. Okay. And each time I remind it, right, what I want it to do, you know, or you can just kind of keep the dialogue going. And again, it's like, yes, you know, more reminders about the things I want to make sure it gets better and better at, you know.\\n[00:59:17.410 -> 00:59:44.054] And I just keep going small bits at a time. And it ends up with a super nice shareable artifact that I shared with my team. And people really appreciated it. People were like, wow, that was such an interesting thing to got a lot of information out of this.\\n[00:59:47.117 -> 01:00:15.714] Yeah, so it's probably a bit different, right? I mean, it probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to do rather than like zero minutes. But for sharing something that's meant to be a really high quality artifact from a really important process of like, you know, multiple people are going to be reading or watching this thing, I think it's really worth doing. Another example was I wanted to teach people how to use\\n[01:00:15.714 -> 01:00:46.485] FastHTML, like what's the purpose of them. So I included a lot of the hypermedia book I just showed you, the summary of it in the project. And also the FastHTML, some of the docs. And so I'm being really very quite focused here on what I'm trying to get out of it. And hoping to kind of think about the kinds of things that people often misunderstand. Like, what the hell is actually a hypermedia application?\\n[01:00:46.485 -> 01:01:09.686] So that's another example of trying to do the kind of FAQ based on things I'm actually getting asked on the Discord to get the kind of answers that I want. So I find that useful. I also did the same approach because FastHTML is based on Starlet. I wanted a really good manual for Starlet.\\n[01:01:09.986 -> 01:01:39.170] People understand the architecture of a fast HTML application. Again, I'm just providing it. And the nice thing about this approach is that each time I build these, I can use more and more of them in the context for the language model. And so they just keep getting better and better. And that's kind of what we're looking for, right? If you let the language model drive a process,\\n[01:01:39.170 -> 01:02:04.322] they're generally going to get worse and worse because of kind of the limitations of these kind of autoregressive approaches. But when you're doing this kind of approach, each dialogue you create is better than the last one. Each prompt response was better than the last one, you know? So again here, like what are the components of fast HTML? How do they work together? And\\n[01:02:09.314 -> 01:02:38.466] you know, again, I'm kind of showing examples that I want them to show me how to do it. And so I tend to kind of, sometimes I provide these gists directly as links from the docs. Sometimes I'll go in and edit the gist, right? And so then this is really important because then when I use this as an input context for another Claude project, right? I can tell Claude like, oh, look out for the notes from me where I've pointed out\\n[01:02:38.466 -> 01:03:04.134] places that previously a model misunderstood it. Here's another one. And it's also for humans, you know, humans, humans that read these things and computers are going to be pretty similar. So Jeremy, if you wanted to summarize another book, would you maybe, and it was like web related, would you then maybe start by taking a section of your HTMX thing that you've done or the whole thing and\\n[01:03:04.354 -> 01:03:34.018] putting that in first? Yeah, if I'm looking for something similar where it's kind of quite a technical book with examples, I would probably say like I'm looking to convert this chapter and include all the examples just like I did with this chapter with those examples. Absolutely. So as you know, Yaku, and I assume this is why you're asking this question, this is called in context learning in AI. And it basically means giving examples of desired outputs for inputs. Language models work dramatically better, like way, way better when it's in context learning.\\n[01:03:34.018 -> 01:04:06.821] The problem is most people don't know how to do that because it's not particularly clear what the examples should be. If I had examples, I wouldn't be asking the question. So here we're building up a library of examples. And again, the kind of the idea here is we're trying to get in this really positive reinforcement loop where every time we use AI, we get better at it and the model gets better at it, exactly.\\n[01:04:06.821 -> 01:13:52.738] Great. Okay. So maybe we'll have a five minute break before we jump into Advent of Code. And when I come back, I will also check the chat to see if anybody has any questions. Sound good, Jaakko? Sounds good to me. Okay. Thank you, sir.\\n[01:13:52.738 -> 01:14:38.185] All right, I'm back. Are you back, Yaku? I am now, yep. We're all back. I was busy reading the Zoom comments. Excellent. Sorry, the YouTube comments. Actually, I'm not quite organized as it turns out.\\n[01:14:38.185 -> 01:15:07.046] I think I'm organized. All right, are we ready for some Advent of Code? And what are we doing? Day three, right? Day three. Okay, so hopefully you've all\\n[01:15:07.554 -> 01:15:25.398] had a try at this already. So let's remind ourselves as to what we're doing. And I think you're sharing, Jeremy. Okay, I should probably do that then. Oh, and I know the shortcut\\n[01:15:37.890 -> 01:16:05.058] need the URL anymore. Okay. Oh, a question in the chat. Robert's asking how I change the answers of the AI. Well nowadays, now that Solveit exists, I would just do it in Solveit. So back then we had some\\n[01:16:05.058 -> 01:16:34.914] different proof of concept approaches I had to use instead. But nowadays, yeah, SolveItDirectly lets you change the answers of the AI. So that's what I would do. All right. The gondola lift isn't working. Engine part's missing. You have to add up all the part numbers. Should be easy to work out which part's missing.\\n[01:16:34.914 -> 01:17:05.410] There's a visual representation of the engine, lots of numbers and symbols. Any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a part number. So we're getting our notation. Okay, so there's a part number. Periods are not symbols. Okay. Great.\\n[01:17:05.410 -> 01:17:34.722] copy that, and we've got a new feature called duplicate, thanks to Jono. So to do, to use that I've now created a little advent of code template, which actually I guess I could also add a little bit of help to here by saying input equals get data\\n[01:17:34.722 -> 01:18:00.745] actually before I do that we should run all, so I get some help for autocomplete. Get data, okay, year equals 2023, and day equals three. Great. And\\n[01:18:00.745 -> 01:18:30.025] really matter what the day is because we're going to be just using this as a template. So then I'm just going to go duplicate. Then I'll click on it. And edit the title here to AOC Day 3. Maybe worth leaving the day empty in your template so you don't accidentally forget to change it.\\n[01:18:30.025 -> 01:19:00.297] I've been caught with that once or twice with you using the wrong days input. That's a really good idea. Okay. AOC day three, part one. Okay. Okay. Import. Column 50 say.\\n[01:19:00.297 -> 01:19:29.182] Okay, so that's our sample. C code. Okay. Okay, sample.\\n[01:19:30.609 -> 01:19:58.274] Okay, there we go. Okay. So what I've noticed is often people seem to find the parsing bit the hardest. I think with the solver approach the parsing bit for me is always the easiest. And the trick is just to go into smaller and smaller pieces for the parsing.\\n[01:19:58.274 -> 01:20:26.338] make the smallest bit work and then gradually build back up again. Now in this case, the goal here is we need to find all of the numbers which have a symbol next to them. So I kind of like to think about what an ideal data structure for that would look like. And I guess rather than this current one,\\n[01:20:26.338 -> 01:20:56.610] Now what I really want to know is where are the numbers and where are the symbols? Where are the numbers to know if it's next to a symbol? I need to know where the number starts and where it ends. Now I happen to know how to do that, but let's assume we don't. So we can ask.\\n[01:20:56.610 -> 01:21:26.370] What is a concise and easy way in Python to find all of the places where a string of digits starts and stops inside a larger string? It's not always easy to explain exactly what you want. You'll notice often, as is the case here, I misspoke and re-spoke, and generally these modern voice-to-text things tend to do a perfectly good job of figuring out\\n[01:21:26.370 -> 01:21:56.245] You don't have to worry about it too much. Okay, ari.findita. So something that Nate added recently, which is really nice, is that any time that you in your prompt or note or the assistant in its response has a function in backticks, it provides a hyperlink to it. So a key, key, key thing.\\n[01:21:56.245 -> 01:22:24.102] is any time that something comes up that you didn't previously know about in Shell Sage or Solvert or Claude or whatever, is stop and go learn about it, right? And that's why this has been made as convenient as possible. Okay, so here is find iter. I'm just going to turn my Discord off because it keeps beeping. There we go.\\n[01:22:25.666 -> 01:22:54.626] find iter return an iterator yielding match objects over all non-overlapping matches oh that sounds interesting non-overlapping for re pattern and string now the thing about documentation like this is it's super concise because it uses bits of jargon as a shorthand right which is a perfectly fine thing to do as long as you always look up the jargon and the jargon is generally in good documentation like python is going to be a hyperlink\\n[01:22:54.626 -> 01:23:22.114] An iterator, what the hell is that? An object representing a stream of data. Each time you call next, you get different successive items in the stream. Again, it's a bit of an infinite tree of jargon, but over time you'll learn these ideas, these core ideas, and you'll be able to read them more quickly. What the hell is a match object? A match object.\\n[01:23:22.114 -> 01:23:51.861] OK, well, basically, the key thing to know about an object is what can it do. So you read through it. It's got an expand. It's got a group. A group can take zero or more group IDs. And then the key thing is the examples. So I would read all that. But for now, I guess the key thing we want to know is basically, how does it work?\\n[01:23:51.861 -> 01:24:19.078] and basically how does it work is what's the signature of it. So if you just pop a question mark there, okay, then you find out. Okay, it's find, iter, pattern, string, flags, and a quick summary. Okay. Okay, regular expressions. I know regular expressions, so I am\\n[01:24:23.170 -> 01:24:53.506] Because I know regular expressions. Regular expressions are amazing. They have a very, very unfair reputation as being difficult. And I think the reason for that is that they are a concise notation, you know, like math.\\n[01:24:53.506 -> 01:25:23.605] example. And things with a concise notation cannot be read at all like math by somebody that doesn't know the notation. It just looks mysterious, right? But just like to a Chinese speaker, Chinese is not hard to read, English is. To an English speaker, you know, Chinese is hard to read. An unfamiliar notation will be unfamiliar until you learn it. But that doesn't mean it's hard to\\n[01:25:23.605 -> 01:25:49.954] Regular expressions makes things easier, much easier. And there's a small subset of regular expressions that I will teach you so that you will know enough to be this person. But yeah, don't let it bother you that they look strange.\\n[01:25:53.986 -> 01:26:21.918] Basically, a regular expression is something that allows you to search through a string to find substrings that match a pattern. And so we're going to describe what some of those things are. Let's first of all create a joined version of the sample, just a smaller version. I'm just going to go sample.replace\\n[01:26:25.461 -> 01:26:54.722] And replace a new line with nothing at all. And we'll start playing with it. Okay. So a regular expression takes a pattern. What's a pattern? It's a string. So just to make this a little bit less typing for me, I will go from re import\\n[01:26:54.722 -> 01:27:24.482] findIDA. Okay. So I can now just type findIDA. And the first thing I need is a pattern, right? So here's a really simple pattern. Four. What does four find? Four finds a four. That's actually, let's do a seven just to make it more interesting. Okay, where do I find it in? Inside my string ss. And findIDA\\n[01:27:24.482 -> 01:27:54.242] returns an iterator. So basically you'll get this kind of thing a lot in Python when it says iterator. Basically what that means is that you get something that you could then loop through later to get all the answers from it. To do that all in one go, I can simply do this. Now that's a lot of work.\\n[01:27:54.242 -> 01:28:25.506] So let's not do that. Let's instead say define findItter. And this is basically a way, a totally standard way, you can always wrap a function and get it to do something else. If you say star args star star keyword args, that basically says pass through everything that you get sent off to something else. We just say return list re.findItter.\\n[01:28:25.506 -> 01:28:55.202] Because I want this to work for me, I want it to work the way I want it to work. And I always want to be able to see the list. So modify your environment to make it work the way you want. So now that we've done that, we can get rid of list. Great. Just little things.\\n[01:28:55.202 -> 01:29:23.906] slightly easy, easier to deal with. Okay, so what's it done? Well, it's looked for all the places that the pattern matches in the string. The pattern is 7, so it's told me that it's found it's matched to 7 at 2 comma 3. Okay, now immediately we've seen something that a lot of people on the Discord messed up, which is\\n[01:29:23.906 -> 01:29:51.522] span is the start and the end, but be careful because look, 0, 1, 2, this is 2, that is the start, the end is past the end, right? So be very careful. It starts at 2 and 3 is just past the end. Which is like, it's not bad, right? Because the difference between the two is 1 and this is of length 1, that's fine, right? But just be careful. So you can see that by\\n[01:29:51.522 -> 01:30:19.670] studying our data as we go, it really helps, right? So we found all the sevens. Do you think they do that so you can slice it nicely? Fits with the slice notation? Yeah, exactly. Ranges work this way. Pretty much everything in Python works this way. Yep. I think that's a great point, Jakko. So no complaints about it, but certainly an easy mistake to make. But again, we read the docs and then we tried it.\\n[01:30:20.002 -> 01:30:50.565] And then we looked at the answer. And so we've got everything we can now. And so being in too much of a hurry with Advent of Code to win the speed race can be a bit of a mistake. Because what we actually want you to do is maximize the learning race here, which is another good reason to do the 2023 version. Because at this point, you're not going to get on the leaderboard. OK. Now being able to find the sevens is somewhat useful, but not super useful. Let's find the digits.\\n[01:30:50.565 -> 01:31:20.770] So here's where what I would do is I'd press command shift up arrow and that creates a new cell with the same as the last cell. And I'm going to show you the first thing to learn about. I'm just going to show you a really minimal set of things which will get you a really long way. The first thing I want to show you is that you can type in a set of things to look for. And a set is always in square brackets. So I want to find\\n[01:31:20.770 -> 01:31:51.405] anything in that set. All right, so there they all are. So that's found four, six, seven, one, one, four. Okay, I'm gonna close that up. Don't quite need all that on my screen at once. That's enough to know, right? But obviously that's a little bit annoying to type all that.\\n[01:31:51.405 -> 01:32:19.426] So it might be useful to know that you can instead use a hyphen to say everything between 0 and 9. You can also do a to z, and there's the same thing. And now we're at the point where it's like, you don't need to learn, this is called a character class, right? So this is a character class, it's all, everything in this set. For what it's worth,\\n[01:32:19.426 -> 01:32:50.114] some character classes are used enough that people have even shorter shortcuts for them. So identical to this is backslash D. Backslash D means a digit. You never need to use it. You can always use square bracket naught to nine. It's slightly less typing to write backslash D. There is, however, a bit of a problem, which is we need to put an R in front of it, and I'll show you why. If I write print,\\n[01:32:50.114 -> 01:33:15.189] backslash n, for example, as you might know, that's not actually a backslash followed by n. That's actually a newline character. So in Python, to say I actually made a backslash, you can write an r at the front, and that means everything in this string, a backslash means a backslash. It means don't turn them into anything fancy.\\n[01:33:15.189 -> 01:33:45.154] R, you can think of it as R for regular expressions, because this is where you use them all the time. So basically, anytime you're using a regular expression, it's not a bad idea to get into the habit of typing R apostrophe or R double quotes all the time. Okay, great. So we've learned about character classes, and I said that we're going to try to stick to the\\n[01:33:45.154 -> 01:34:15.170] minimal necessary bit. So then the second main thing to know about in, um, regular expressions is that after a character class, which could, this is a character class, this contains number seven, it's a set of possible things. This contains the set of those things. After that, you can then, um, add, uh, a second character to say, how many times do you want that to appear? By default, you want it to appear once. So there's a single four, a single six, a single seven. Okay. Um,\\n[01:34:15.170 -> 01:34:45.937] If I want one or more times, plus. Plus means the previous character plus one or more times, which is actually what we want, right? So if we submit that, then I think we can agree that's looking pretty good. 4, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 35. You see? And they're not overlapping. So there's all the places that we want.\\n[01:34:45.937 -> 01:35:14.437] So Dr. Mikko on the chat says he quite likes writing regexes, but finds them hard to read. And they're hard to read in the same way that math is hard to read, which is two possible reasons. One is you don't know some of the symbols. And the second is you try to read it too fast. So the only way to read a regular expression is to go through every single piece bit by bit.\\n[01:35:14.437 -> 01:35:41.626] Now one way that can make that a lot easier is to go to somewhere like regex101.com and paste in your test string without the quotes and\\n[01:35:45.442 -> 01:36:15.362] in your regular expression and say this is a Python regular expression and notice here how it says oh I'm always going to put an R in front of it by default so that's nice and you can see exactly what's going on right zero to nine match the single character present in the list zero through nine okay followed by\\n[01:36:15.362 -> 01:36:39.698] single character, plus matches the previous token, one to infinity times, and then here you can see all the matches. Okay, so this is a a good way to, you know, check your understanding, but also as you can see solve it's also a good way to check your understanding.\\n[01:36:43.061 -> 01:37:14.121] So let's try that then. This is looking pretty good. Let's try it in Samp. Again, this is why you, you know, want to do this stuff carefully. Make sure it all works and like, oh look at that. That worked too. So we don't really need that SS thing. So I'll just delete that.\\n[01:37:14.121 -> 01:37:41.834] Is the ss closer to what the real one is going to look like to me? Oh no, they have the backslash n's in there, don't they? Yeah, they have the backslash n's and we actually care about what line it's on. Yeah, that's right, sorry. So, we actually need to know something. This is not quite the right answer. Like, you could turn this into the right answer, to be honest, because each line is some particular length. So,\\n[01:37:42.338 -> 01:38:11.906] It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's 10 long. So if we did this integer divided by 10, it tells you what row it's on. And if you did this mod 10, it would tell you what column it's on. But why use math when you don't need to? I'm not a huge fan of that idea. So instead,\\n[01:38:11.906 -> 01:38:40.578] we're going to try and do it a bit smarter, a bit simpler. And I'm going to just go back, so I've got a somewhere around a neat little, yeah this, I'm just going to steal this. I'll show you this in a moment because it comes up quite a lot. So I always like to be able to visualize things easily.\\n[01:38:40.578 -> 01:39:10.769] I should probably put this actually in my template because it comes up so much. But here's a command called show. And it's going to go through each row in some matrix. When I say matrix, it's just a list of strings. And it's going to print it out along with some numbers. And I'll just show you what that looks like. So if I say show samp. Oh, what did I do wrong? Ah.\\n[01:39:10.769 -> 01:39:45.173] So first of all, exactly, so before I would do that I would always say lines equals samp dot split lines. And very often I like to run, I've modified something up here, I want to modify, run everything below. So don't forget we have a run below button, so that runs all my messages below. And obviously this then needs to be lines.\\n[01:39:45.173 -> 01:40:15.157] Okay, so I think that's a bit easier, right? Because now I can immediately kind of see the coordinates of everything. And so I can kind of more easily now check whether I'm getting back the coordinates I want. So 4, 6, 7, I want to see something saying, oh, it starts at 0, 0 and ends at 0, 3, just one past the end, or 0, 2, depending on how we do it. Maybe we want 0, 2.\\n[01:40:15.157 -> 01:40:46.050] And then like 35 starts at 2 comma 2 and ends at 2, 3 or 4, so forth. So the row it's on is actually pretty straightforward. That's just going to be the row number as I loop through each one. And the column, we know how to get that for the start and the end, we can get from find . So that feels reasonably straightforward, right? We can\\n[01:40:46.050 -> 01:41:16.706] So when the lines represent a matrix, I often like just to call it m, because there's nothing particularly special about them being lines, right? So perhaps you folks remember from last time, we've seen that you can go for i comma o in enumerate, and that just, oh yeah, and you always need\\n[01:41:16.706 -> 01:41:46.498] parentheses in my list comprehension. Okay. So there's my row numbers. It's kind of quite nice, along with each one. And so then for each one we want findItter. And we want to find the digits. So let's grab that. And we could even say, like, digitsRe is this. Okay.\\n[01:41:46.498 -> 01:42:16.642] And then we'll just go copy and paste. And rather than O, we will say, well, we've got our new special find data, which listifies it for us, which is rather nice. And so first of all, we pass in the pattern. And then we pass the thing to search through.\\n[01:42:16.642 -> 01:42:42.549] So here we go. 0 has two things, 4, 6, 7, and 1, 1, 4. Nice. 1 has nothing. 2 has two things. 4. Yeah, it looks pretty good. 9 has two things. That looks pretty nice, right? So what I like to do now then is to think about like, OK, well,\\n[01:42:42.549 -> 01:43:08.522] be the nicest possible way to have this? It's basically like, oh I want a little object which has the row number and the start and stop column, and also what digit it is, right? So something I find really useful for this is to be able to like instantly create any object I want. And there's a nice little thing in Python called\\n[01:43:08.834 -> 01:43:38.946] simple namespace. And I use it so much I tend to give it a different name. I tend to call it NS. And so basically you can create it like this. You just start creating a little object. There's my little object. So I want to create something for parts. They said a part is a string of digits. So as usual,\\n[01:43:38.946 -> 01:44:08.086] I would call it underscore part. And it's going to take two things. It's going to take the y that it's on, which is here, okay, and it's going to take the match object, which I'll call mo. And so we're going to return, okay, and what are we going to return? We need the span\\n[01:44:08.853 -> 01:44:39.305] So let's just come back to that. So let's grab one of these, right? Let's grab, if we grab this, give this a name. Sorry, not that. Yeah, grab this. Which one do we really want? We just want one match object to play with.\\n[01:44:39.305 -> 01:45:11.778] So how about we just grab this and we'll call this matchObjects. And so that way it's going to be easy to play with one, right? So matchObject equals matchObjects zero. MatchObject. Okay, great. So this is where you can just save a bit of time.\\n[01:45:11.778 -> 01:45:39.950] How do I grab the starting point, the ending point, and the matched string converted to an integer for a single match? mo.start, mo.end, and mo.group.\\n[01:45:41.570 -> 01:46:06.401] So return, okay, a namespace containing, so our starting x I'll call x1 equals mo.start, our end2 we'll call mo.end,\\n[01:46:06.401 -> 01:46:34.810] I think I want the start and the end to be semantically the same, so I'm going to subtract one from it because that's actually where it ends. And then we've got the y, of course, which we can just pop here, and then the digit equals int mo.group. Okay, so\\n[01:46:37.410 -> 01:47:04.658] Now that we've done that, of course, we should immediately test it. So underscore part, and we're going to be passing in y. So for the first part that's 0, and the match object is mo. And there we go. How's that looking, Yaku? It's looking pretty good.\\n[01:47:05.058 -> 01:47:33.354] I guess one question I had, Jeremy, it's just with the namespace. Maybe you said that while I was out. Do you just prefer that over like a data class because of more concise writing? Or is there another reason you like that one? Sure. So Yaku's asking about this approach here called a data class, which we could absolutely do, which is where you add a decorator.\\n[01:47:34.245 -> 01:48:00.565] since we've been seeing decorators. And so this is going to be something, it doesn't just take a function and return a function, it can also take a class and return a class. And so we could create a capital P part. And we could say x1 which is an int. And x2 is also an int. Oops, you did the wrong button.\\n[01:48:00.565 -> 01:48:27.878] And y is also an int. And our digit is also an int. And that's totally fine as well. Sorry, what did I do wrong there? Oh, x1 colon int. Don't mind me.\\n[01:48:31.145 -> 01:49:00.450] just don't know Python. Okay, and so then you can do the same kind of thing. Now one nice thing about data classes is that as long as you stick to the same order, you define them, you don't have to say all the equals. So if I go x1, x2, yd, I can say x1, sorry, yeah, x1, x2, yd.\\n[01:49:00.450 -> 01:49:32.413] That's totally fine too. Yeah, you know, for me, I don't know. This is an extra step. I don't like extra steps. This was less steps because I still need to write underscore part, you know, but I'm fine with either. They're both nice that they print out. One nice thing about data class is it prints out the type of thing or else this one has no type. It's just a namespace. All right.\\n[01:49:32.413 -> 01:50:01.173] So, what we now want to do is we want to get, for every row, we want to get every part. So, I would be inclined then to say, like, I've got some particular row, m, 0, and let's do things in really, really small steps. Okay, so there's my first row.\\n[01:50:01.173 -> 01:50:30.630] There was a question, Jeremy, where you've got underscore part, and then you've got a zero and an MO. They're wondering why zero? Yeah, because this is what we're going to be going through, right? We're going to be going through all the rows. And so on each row, we're going to have the row number and all the matches. So that's where we get our Y from. Yeah. So in this example, we're just looking at the first row, and that's what the zero is. Exactly. So this match here was on the first row.\\n[01:50:31.170 -> 01:51:00.498] index 0, yep. Cool, so we basically could now just grab this, right, put that in a function maybe, so we'll copy and paste. We've already got that re defined, so let's just say def row matches\\n[01:51:01.634 -> 01:51:31.106] Okay, so we're going to be going through the row. And actually, you know, I'm making a mistake here, aren't I, because I'm trying to do it in too many steps, so let's get rid of the def for now and actually do it for real.\\n[01:51:31.106 -> 01:51:59.874] What I'm going to be doing then is that's my, you know, that's my row matches. Oh, and I guess digre was 0 to 9 plus. Oh, so it's actually, we're not looping through anything.\\n[01:51:59.874 -> 01:52:29.154] we're just doing, ah yes, actually what we want to do, oh we don't even need a numerate. Okay, so that's actually pretty straightforward. So it's good that we're doing this in small steps. So we want find iter, that's our row matches, in our row.\\n[01:52:29.154 -> 01:52:58.690] And so now we want to create parts from that. So if we now loop through each one of those. And so we'll call that row parts actually. We loop through each one of those. Okay, so here they all are. Okay. And we're going to want to call underscore part. And remember underscore part.\\n[01:52:58.690 -> 01:53:27.466] the match object and the y. So these are both in the first row, and the match object is going to be something that's coming out of this. Now, so they're the two things, so that's good. So something interesting about this is that we're just calling a function\\n[01:53:29.122 -> 01:53:57.334] on everything in some list. So what I'd be inclined to do then is to change our definition of part. So it's always nice to have the thing that varies come second, and you'll see y in a tick. So we're gonna get lots of matches per y. So let's put the y second. Check that still works.\\n[01:54:02.517 -> 01:54:29.710] does. And what that means we can do is say, come a second, is we can say l findEta\\n[01:54:39.389 -> 01:55:04.002] So create a, oopsie-daisy, create a part. Don't know how that happened. Create a part for every match object, right? Now each of those parts needs to know what the y is, so we can then say y equals zero.\\n[01:55:04.002 -> 01:55:34.818] So either is fine, but I'm just showing you this way to say there's a kind of a way of just getting a bit more into the flow of these things by recognizing that basically you're just list processing, you know, and you can just like, oh, I'm just mapping a function, I'm just mapping a function. Neither is necessarily better or worse. So this is row matches. And it's for, it's quite nice to see, like, what do we need exactly?\\n[01:55:34.818 -> 01:56:05.922] We need a row and we need a y, okay? So, y, comma, row. And so we can just check that works. Row matches, zero, comma, row. Probably a good idea to return it.\\n[01:56:05.922 -> 01:56:35.298] Okay, so this might look familiar, zero row. What's row? Remember, that's our row. And so actually then, we can now do this. Think about this, right? We go L, our matrix, right?\\n[01:56:35.298 -> 01:57:06.328] So that's all of the rows of our matrix. Dot enumerate. So there's all the rows of our matrix with the line number followed by the line. And those are the two things that I want to pass into row matches. Now I've got to be a bit careful here, because probably I want to say dot map.\\n[01:57:06.328 -> 01:57:31.362] But, Jaco, do you see why that's not going to work? Because row matches wants to take two things. Two things, exactly. And it's going to be sent one thing. It's a tuple. Yeah. Yeah. Tuple's just like a list, but we're going to be learning a lot more about tuples in future lessons. It's a very important data structure. So we want to basically destructure that tuple to send the two things separately.\\n[01:57:31.362 -> 01:58:01.026] And there's a thing in the standard library in Python called star map, which does map, but does exactly that. It destructures it. And so L has that as well. So L tries to have all the kinds of useful bits with the standard library in it as well. Okay. So we seem to have found 10 parts here. Or not quite. What have we found? We found not 10 parts.\\n[01:58:01.026 -> 01:58:30.914] Here's a list for the first row. Here's a list for the second row. Here's a list for the third row. So we need to concatenate all those lists together. Yeah. So this is quite often when you do this more functional approach, you often find yourself just clicking on the previous one and adding a little bit to it. And now we seem to have found 10 parts. So I reckon we should\\n[01:58:30.914 -> 01:58:59.713] double check that. Would dot sum work on that last one as well, Jeremy? Yes. No. Kind of. Yes, I think so. Summing lists should work. Oh dear. What are you doing to us, Yaku?\\n[01:58:59.713 -> 01:59:28.994] And the reason that works is quite nice. It's because sum just means apply plus. And in Python, applying plus to lists concatenates them. But that was awful. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nice. We found them.\\n[01:59:28.994 -> 01:59:56.750] So like I said, that wasn't fast, right? But it's not clever. We didn't have to keep anything in our head because we're just doing a little bit at a time. And so now that we've got that, we need the same thing for star.\\n[01:59:58.530 -> 02:00:29.929] And I'm rather inclined then just to say like, well, okay, this is a part. And like, I like to reuse stuff. So why don't we create a star? And that's going to return, now stars are always one long, so that goes to return an x. And it's not an integer anymore. That should always be a star, but let's change as little as possible.\\n[02:00:29.929 -> 02:00:58.698] And then We then called so that's how star okay, and then we called row matches We probably should have called that Let's change it now. You know when you like that's that was a mistake. This is a thing that creates parts Parts\\n[02:01:00.514 -> 02:01:24.510] Because if you kind of later on realize your notation wasn't ideal and you don't change it, then you'll be like, oh no, now everything's all, you know, confused and my brain's messed up, especially if your brain's a bit small and slow like mine is, right? Yeah, parts, that's much better, right? Because now we can say stars.\\n[02:01:35.064 -> 02:02:01.890] Now, a star does not actually mean a literal star in a regular expression. Star is a lot like plus. It's something that says how many of the previous token do you want? But we say no, we actually want a star. So remember, backslash is something that you can add to something that would normally be a special character class and make it not special.\\n[02:02:01.890 -> 02:02:30.710] Actually, we don't just want stars, do we? We actually want, is that right? Yeah, well, there's a sign as well. Okay, so we shouldn't call them stars. We should call them symbols. Yeah. Symbols. And so I think the Advent of Code question defines them not by what they are, but by what they're not, which is actually great.\\n[02:02:32.162 -> 02:02:59.617] already learnt this for a set. And so you might remember in math there's something called the complement of a set. The complement of a set is everything not in that set. So they were defined as being anything that is not a digit and not a full stop. And so let's use our shorthand. Instead of writing square brackets 0 to 9, we're like, oh no, we could just do that. So the complement of a set is caret. So this now means everything not in this set.\\n[02:02:59.617 -> 02:03:28.754] out everything that's not in the set would be too hard, so let's just write it as not the complement of the set, not zero to nine, and not a full stop. Do you need a backslash on the full stop? You do not, because it's inside square brackets. Okay. But, you know, absolutely no harm, so you don't have to know. Full stop is a special character class, meaning anything at all.\\n[02:03:29.442 -> 02:04:00.194] regular expression, which is why Yaku wanted us to be a bit careful of how we dealt with that. Okay, so then we're going to look for all of the sims. That won't quite work yet, because we don't have sim. That's fine, we'll just let it be wrong. We'll go back here, change that to sim, and then run all below. Okay, and not a great row to be testing on.\\n[02:04:00.194 -> 02:04:30.434] So let's do, let's do row 8, because it's got two things on it. Row equals m8, never assume you get anything right, always write it immediately afterwards, otherwise the one time you don't, it'll be broken. Okay, so we found our symbols, right, so like don't spend time thinking, just use what you've done.\\n[02:04:30.434 -> 02:04:59.894] So we don't want parts anymore, we want symbols. And so we've got our symbols, that's good. And so then we just did this, right? So copy, paste, star map, sims. Okay. So now we could say def.\\n[02:05:01.186 -> 02:05:31.906] We want to return two things. Let's do them separately. I guess we'll be a bit lazy about this. It's always good. Copy, paste. So symbols. Okay. And parts.\\n[02:05:31.906 -> 02:06:01.570] I always like to line things up so I can see more clearly I sort of messed something up. And this is the kind of thing that almost no automatic code formatter will use, which will do, which is why I never use an automatic code formatter. I always like to do things as clearly as possible for a human, even if that means typing an extra space myself manually. So then let's return the parts and the symbols.\\n[02:06:01.570 -> 02:06:32.066] And so now we can say, parts comma symbols equals pars our matrix. Check the parts. So, you know, I'm really slow, right? I just check everything as I go. But like, if the thing was originally presented to us like this, we'd probably not find it particularly difficult, right? You'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.\\n[02:06:32.066 -> 02:07:04.904] all in the format that we want at this point. All right, so then always nice to just keep reminding yourself what the problem looks like. Cool. So we want to know which parts are adjacent to a symbol.\\n[02:07:04.904 -> 02:07:36.610] So, let's pick a part and a symbol. Look at them. Because our brains are pretty good at dealing with single things, right? Is this symbol adjacent to this part?\\n[02:07:36.610 -> 02:08:08.610] very suspicious about this. I think our symbols are wrong. Are they? Yes, they are. They're always y equals 0. Ah, also here, y equals 0. So I made the mistake. I printed things out as I went, but I didn't bother to read them. Cool. And you can see why, right? y equals 0. So let's fix those two things. So we want parts.\\n[02:08:08.610 -> 02:08:34.358] Y equals row. Y equals Y, rather. Okay, and then symbols. Y equals Y. And then something I like to do a lot is to say clear and run all.\\n[02:08:41.186 -> 02:09:12.833] And that's more like it. Cool. All right. So let's see. y equals 1 is adjacent to y equals 0. So that makes it look like they're next to each other there. This goes from 0 to 2. And this is 3. So yeah, it looks like it is. And yeah, it is. All right. So I could basically say like, right, OK.\\n[02:09:12.833 -> 02:09:42.257] You know, this is the kind of thing I'm always like, well, I don't know. I can type it, I suppose. Or particularly because I can kind of type it in a nice way, right? I basically want to make sure that p.x1, let's think about this. We want to make sure that the symbol x has to be greater than p.x1.\\n[02:09:42.257 -> 02:10:12.149] or equal to, and that one there is minus one because it can be diagonal, right? So it's got to be less than that. And then the symbol.x has to be less than or equal to the parts x2 plus one. And again this is where it's nice that we kind of fixed up those edges as we went, so it's more symmetrical and\\n[02:10:12.149 -> 02:10:42.178] I don't know if you've seen this before, but this is one of these things that might be a bit easier if we did that. This is quite a common pattern in Python. This means that this is between these two numbers. Okay, so we want it to be between those two numbers. And we also\\n[02:10:42.178 -> 02:11:10.965] want the parts y minus 1 to be within the bounds for the y. So like if it's not nice and symmetrical it's always useful to think about y, right. So this one, this one should be true, and it is. Okay, so that's nice. So add a copy and we'll say def\\n[02:11:10.965 -> 02:11:41.250] And then I'd say is, I always like to like use is for my notation for things that are kind of like is something true. So is adjacent. Is this part adjacent to this symbol? And because I use the same things in my parameters, I don't have to worry here about changing anything else. So I won't accidentally have a bug there. So then I'll say is adjacent. I mean, look, obviously this should work. It's the same code, but I still run it just because I'm that anal.\\n[02:11:41.250 -> 02:12:12.450] Okay, cool. So hopefully you can see why this is quite nice, right? Because all I need to do is go through, to know whether it has a symbol next to it, is to go through all the symbols and see if it's adjacent to my part, right? So remember, I've got my symbols.\\n[02:12:12.450 -> 02:12:41.218] There they are. And so I want to go through all of them and see if they're adjacent to my part. Now that's interesting because again, we want the more varying thing to come first. Because it just makes life easier. Because now we can just say, oh yeah, let's go through all the symbols. And for each one,\\n[02:12:41.218 -> 02:13:18.332] going to see if it's adjacent to my part. Let's see, so I've gone through all my symbols. Check if it's adjacent. So my symbol comes in first. Rerun.\\n[02:13:18.332 -> 02:13:45.769] Oh, symbols.map p equals p. My bad. There we go. So yeah, the first one's adjacent. And so we can now say, has adjacency, right? Does, um,\\n[02:13:45.769 -> 02:14:17.001] part have any adjacency has adjacency for my part. And I want to check it has an adjacency if any of these are true, right?\\n[02:14:17.001 -> 02:14:51.253] one does have an adjacency. And so which ones do we want to keep? We want to keep the ones which do have an adjacency. They said sum up all of the… I always forget. Sum up all the part numbers, and a part is something that is next to a symbol.\\n[02:14:51.253 -> 02:15:16.629] let's go through then, and we'll see, let's go through all of our parts. So make sure we know what they look like. So there's all of our parts. Parts. Okay, filter. All of those that have an adjacency. And kind of when you write this out,\\n[02:15:16.629 -> 02:15:47.330] It should sound a lot like English, right? Go through the parts, filter out to find the ones that have an adjacency. Should there be eight of them? I think there was, right? Yeah, there's only two that aren't. Okay, go through all the parts that have an adjacency and sum them up. Okay, getting pretty close.\\n[02:15:47.330 -> 02:16:16.098] wrong there. Oh right, we didn't want to sum up their d attributes. Okay, so to grab all of their d attributes there's a thing in Python's data library called attrGetter which grabs all of something with an attribute. And so in this thing we have something called attrGot. We want to grab all of the d's. Okay, so there's the d from everyone. So go through\\n[02:16:16.098 -> 02:16:45.326] parts, find out the ones with the adjacency, grab their D attributes and sum them up. Okay, getting better. This one here we've called symbols but we didn't actually pass it in, so let's pass it in. That's important. Okay, which means this one we now need to add\\n[02:16:48.977 -> 02:17:18.433] How's that looking, Yaku? 4361. Cool. So I got the right answer. So that's kind of what you want to see. It's like if we have a bug, we don't have to look through 50 lines of code, you know. We just look at one at a time. It also helps in like when we switch to the input.\\n[02:17:18.433 -> 02:17:47.445] if you have a bug, you know, you can kind of do it in much smaller pieces as well. I don't remember, I think we already grabbed the input, right, in our template. Yes, we did, cool. So all we need to do now is basically go through and see what we did. So we went, okay, we did m equals sample dot split lines.\\n[02:17:47.445 -> 02:18:15.646] Copy, paste. Oh yeah, we did parse, didn't we? So then we did parse. Let's find that. Parse. Cool. So copy, paste. And I think that's basically it. Then we did this one here.\\n[02:18:19.205 -> 02:18:46.978] And then that becomes imp. Okay. Submit. All right. 544664. There we go. 544664. So I'm going to wrap it up there. We've got one more part.\\n[02:18:48.002 -> 02:19:16.657] But the reason I want to wrap it up there is the exercise I want you all to go through is to replicate that style, and then part B of the puzzle, can you do it in the same way? And it should be like very small, you know, because you've got basically the parser already,\\n[02:19:16.657 -> 02:19:45.685] the idea of adjacency already. So, you know, have a go at that. Yeah, cool. Any thoughts before we wrap up, Jaakko? No, I think my only thoughts is\\n[02:19:45.685 -> 02:20:15.893] Even myself, I've been programming for quite a while, been adopting the style a little bit more. How's it going? I mean, I imagine it's a bit of rethinking required because you're a very experienced programmer. Yeah, I think there is a bit of rethinking and sometimes it can feel like a bit slower, but it's one of those things. It's like go slow to go fast. And I see...\\n[02:20:15.893 -> 02:20:45.026] some other solutions. The thing I like about it is I'd like to come back to it six months from now, and I think I'd still be able to read all those little functions easily and see all that. And you can run an experiment with them. Yeah, exactly. Which is something that's very often not true of bad code. Also, you might have forgotten how find itter works by then. I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't because you know it, but people were less experienced with it.\\n[02:20:45.026 -> 02:21:09.714] And now it's there, because you could be like, oh, why did the y-ness 1 there? It's like, oh, you can see, oh, it's more consistent this way. Yeah, exactly. So I think that sort of self-documenting nature is very handy. And some things work better with loops and an imperative style, and we'll come across those soon enough. You know, this is just a case of having more tools in your toolkit.\\n[02:21:10.530 -> 02:21:40.130] And you can see also the way we're modifying our tools to work in a way. So a lot of tools in Python 3, they changed from 2 to 3 to make it more focused on speed rather than working well on a REPL. So for things which is nearly always we don't care about speed, you only care about speed in the inner loop of a thing that is slower than you need it to be. So in those cases, fine, you might need to go back and use some of Python 3's\\n[02:21:40.130 -> 02:22:10.153] approaches, but we're modifying things to work the way we want them to in this interactive environment because we want to interact with them constantly. So I think that's something people don't do enough of, I find, is modifying stuff so it works in a way that's convenient. And I think the other thing that's really nice about this approach is it's unlike a Java or something where the thing that you're modifying might be like three classes over\\n[02:22:10.153 -> 02:22:37.429] And so you're constantly having to jump all over the place and you modify something here and that then has a knock-on effect, which on the third file that you weren't really thinking about, now it's like everything here is like in the one context, which I think you can really appreciate. And Yaku, I don't think I've talked to this with you before. So what's your relationship with regular expressions? Are you in the...\\n[02:22:37.429 -> 02:23:05.598] oh, they're useful, we'll reach them, but I have to, but they're such a pain, or are you in the like, oh, I dream about them, or where are you in the regular expression? I definitely don't dream about them too often, but I do like them just because, yeah, like I've used them enough that they're kind of relatively getting easy. So you will have experienced this thing, though, of a lot of folks\\n[02:23:06.626 -> 02:23:30.357] bet some of your colleagues actively avoid them or be like, no, don't use that, too confusing. Yeah. And I think what we often do at work, if it's a particularly, like there are many parts to the regular expression as we'll document, like, okay, like the first part's doing this,\\n[02:23:30.357 -> 02:24:01.026] it's like have a doc string beneath it even for yourself like coming back to it a while later it can just help yeah maybe we'll look at that later at some ways of documenting and splitting up regular expressions there's some neat approaches for that so i think my message for people today is if you're new to them you recognize that um all you need is square brackets plus and star basically you know um\\n[02:24:01.026 -> 02:24:31.717] Even dot, you know, dot means anything. You can create dot with square brackets, but it's easier just to have dot. And that's all you need. We'll learn about parentheses shortly as well, which is a nice little addition. But with, you know, with find iter, square brackets, including the carrot version. So a set, the complement of a set. So they're your character classes or anything at all. Yeah. Followed by star, zero or more.\\n[02:24:31.717 -> 02:24:55.138] plus one or more gets you a really long way and there are other nice things you know as you were saying people can sometimes be a bit worried about like oh it can be slow because you've done a regex or whatever so in in this jupiter type environment something i like to do is use like the at time it um or percent time it um so that it you can very quickly just test like\\n[02:24:55.138 -> 02:25:23.618] okay, if I have this big input, how fast is it gonna be? And you can get your ranges on like what to expect. Yeah, and regular expressions are written in C, right? So actually most regular expressions are gonna be much faster than doing something by hand in Python. If you try to get too tricky, it's possible to construct regular expressions, which are ridiculously slow. And we did see this recently with one of the Advent of Code 2024 things where people were constructing some rather hairy regular expressions\\n[02:25:23.618 -> 02:25:52.450] causing Python to take more than two minutes to solve it and we're saying hey Jeremy solve it's broken. That's like I don't know what the nice way to say is like no man your regular expression's broken but yeah keep them simple and if they take a really long time then yeah try to split it up and simplify it or ask solve it for help. Okay so we've got a few weeks off until\\n[02:25:52.450 -> 02:26:23.042] January the 6th or something like that. So this is a great opportunity to practice what you've been learning. You know, maybe try writing some documentation. Maybe try writing some meeting notes. Maybe try doing some things you didn't think you could do before. Maybe try doing day 25 of previous things. Maybe, you know, like pick something that's maybe, you know, learning something that you didn't feel like you understood. Like, I don't know, dynamic programming or...\\n[02:26:23.042 -> 02:26:50.030] You know, do something that was a bit beyond you, or you've previously found menial, or you've previously been told you're not particularly good at, and try to solve it for you. And try doing stuff in Cursor, in Cloud Projects, in Colab, in whatever, and share, you know, your experiences. Because a lot of people are asking us, hey, how do we use these ideas at work, you know?\\n[02:26:50.402 -> 02:27:18.397] where we use VS Code, or we use Zed, or we use Cursor, or we use Visual Studio, or whatever. And how do I do it in a way that fits well with my colleagues who don't use these styles? How do I work with NBDev to export things? These are all things that we need you to help us with, right? Because we've only got the experience of using this at AnswerAI.\\n[02:27:18.397 -> 02:27:47.709] When I answer AI, we're all using it and we all use NBDev and, you know, we don't necessarily know the answers to these questions. So we would love help, share your experiences, build new tools and have a lot of fun, of course, with Shell Sage. Thanks for joining us today, Yaku. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody. And have a very Merry Christmas to those of you that celebrate it. A very excellent summer for those of us in Australia.\\n[02:27:47.709 -> 02:27:51.619] Winter for those of you in the Northern Hemisphere. Bye. See you.\""

              "\"[00:00:06.249 -> 00:00:21.714] Okay, I think we are live. Hi everybody. Can you all hear me okay?\\n[00:01:02.338 -> 00:01:34.018] Looks like it took quite a while to start, but I think it might have started now. Let's see. Okay, we're on. Great. Sorry about that. Okay. Jono has mysteriously morphed into Nate and Yaku. I don't exactly know how that happened, but hello, Nate. Hello, Yaku. Thanks for being here. Happy to be here.\\n[00:01:34.018 -> 00:02:03.285] I want to say hi, Yaku, so your face appears. Hey everyone. Yaku is actually in Queensland, but not actually in front of that particular island display. Where's your island display from today, Yaku? It's constantly changing, I know. This particular island display is up in the Whitsundays. That's actually where they filmed Pirates of the Caribbean. Definitely recommend.\\n[00:02:03.285 -> 00:02:33.257] checking it out if you come to Australia. Yeah going sailing in the Whitsundays is one of the best experiences of my life I've got to admit. Moving on from sailing in the Whitsundays, a quick logistics notice just you should click stop Solvert in your dashboard and reconnect to make sure you've got the current version because we had a quick little fix to some new functionality we'll show today which is the duplicate button which you'll find there\\n[00:02:33.257 -> 00:03:01.705] on your server. Today, we are going to start by not using SolveIt, but by instead using something that Nate released this week after giving us all at Answer.ai the great joy of being able to use it for the last few weeks. And it's literally a life-changing experience for me. So without further ado, Nate, tell us what you\\n[00:03:01.705 -> 00:03:25.133] built and how it connects to all this Solve It bizzle? Yeah, so I created Shell Sage, which is a bit of a mouthful. The code name at Answer.ai is Bash Buddy, which is a lot easier and friendlier. But Shell Sage is an AI assistant right in your terminal.\\n[00:03:25.133 -> 00:03:40.245] and the really great thing about having a ai assistant right in your terminal is that through the power of tmux it can actually see what you're seeing and this gives it\\n[00:03:40.245 -> 00:04:05.437] the same sort of context awareness that you see when using SolveIt. So, for example, in SolveIt, when you're writing to the AI assistant, it can see all of your messages above, whether or not that's the code and the output of the code or any notes that you've written to yourself or previous messages from the AI assistant. And so it can give you context-specific information.\\n[00:04:05.437 -> 00:04:34.278] answers that you wouldn't be able to get if you were, say, copying and pasting your code and stuff into, say, ChatGPT or copying and pasting outputs from a terminal into ChatGPT. And I think what happened is, like a lot of us at AnswerAI now, when we use an archaic system which is not connected\\n[00:04:34.645 -> 00:05:03.549] like directly seeing what we're working on and connected with an AI, it feels hopelessly obsolete. And so, you know, when we were working in bash on our server, for example, it felt ridiculous to have to do things myself or have to tell an AI what I'm doing and what happened. And so you've basically bought all that to, to the terminal and, oh dear, somebody in the chat, uh, Justin Hong might have to be banned for bad punning.\\n[00:05:03.549 -> 00:05:26.313] Just like humans, shells age. He put the space in before that. That is just terrible. So, dear. So why don't you, what are you going to give us a demo so we can see it live? Great. I also want to make a quick shout out to to\\n[00:05:26.313 -> 00:05:54.850] Richard Rees in the Discord. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Actually, I'm going to be going through this one shortly. So he's going to get a big shout out. OK, great. Yeah. OK, great. Yes. So if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, which is great. And we're actually going to do the first step anyways on a new server. So let me go ahead and swap over to that. So I've been teaching the AnswerAI Team System Administration in recent weeks. And we've actually been using Shell Sage as\\n[00:05:54.850 -> 00:06:23.690] part of that. So everybody now has their own little server that they have launched, a nice fresh server that we used OpenStack to launch automatically from the command line. So I guess this is your fresh new server, Nate. Yes. And it's called Sadmin because I always have issues when it comes to system administration, but Shell Sage is turning that around. So this is a very bare bones installation of Ubuntu 2024.\\n[00:06:24.169 -> 00:06:52.105] and the only real sort of package that i've added to it is conda so that i can install shellfish this service costing you six dollars a month i believe so yeah we went for the extra two gigabytes of ram we're big ballers here at answer um and so one thing that's really nice with shell sage is you can also use it to bootstrap so if you don't have tmux or anything installed you can also\\n[00:06:52.105 -> 00:07:20.577] get shell sage to help you out with getting all of that set up. So I can do pip install shell sage to get the most recent version. And we're basically in business. I can type s sage to invoke shell sage. And since I don't have tmux installed, if I were to try and ask it a question, it will first generate an error, which will be fixed in a future version very soon. But if I don't want that,\\n[00:07:20.577 -> 00:07:51.589] I just have to do dash dash nh, which stands for no history. Basically, don't use tmux. And just a question from the audience here about what kind of computer is this we're logging into. This is from a company called Genesis Hosting. Genesis Hosting, like a lot of folks, uses an open standard called OpenStack, which is really nice. So by using an OpenStack provider, we're able to basically use the same scripts and processes across all the providers we want.\\n[00:07:51.589 -> 00:08:22.437] Yeah, think about it as like AWS's CLI or GCPs, but actually it's Fain. And open. And open, yes. So let's go ahead and see how to install Tmux. So Tmux is, you're going to be telling us more about it for now, though suffice to say it's something that SalesAge needs in order to provide the context understanding of what you've typed recently and what answers you've got back recently.\\n[00:08:22.437 -> 00:08:37.417] Yeah. And as you can see, it gives me a few options. So I know that I'm on a Debian slash Ubuntu server, so I'm going to use the apt install version. And then it says I can launch tmux by just invoking the command afterwards.\\n[00:08:37.417 -> 00:09:04.117] And also I can use a man tmux to get some information about what tmux is. So we'll go ahead and do that. There's no history as in you're saying I don't have tmux installed. So we'll probably remove the need for that pretty soon. It'll check for itself where the tmux is there and maybe give you a warning. Yeah. Isaac gave a really cool way of doing that. So we'll be pushing a new version shortly.\\n[00:09:04.117 -> 00:09:33.049] All right, so I installed that. I'll go ahead and just open up Tmux's man pages by typing the other command that Shell Sage provided. And so here is basically the actual documentation behind Tmux. It stands for a terminal multiplexer, and it just basically enables creating sessions and managing different types of,\\n[00:09:33.049 -> 00:09:47.794] like shell environments in a single window in a really clean and easy way. And it's very popular among system administrators. And so we can go ahead and\\n[00:09:48.225 -> 00:10:14.326] read through this documentation, but we have Shell Sage, so we can use Shell Sage to help us out here. Let's go ahead and launch TMUX. As you can see, some stuff just changed a little bit. I now am in like a fresh new environment. I also have this bar at the bottom that's green that has some information on it. And in the bottom here, you have information about the session you were in.\\n[00:10:14.729 -> 00:10:44.546] You don't really have to worry about it. We at Answer just usually use one session. And then within that session, we'll use some other stuff like windows or panes, which I'll show you shortly, to have different working areas. And so now let's go ahead and ask Shel Sage, how do I use, to give you a bit of a understanding of how TMux sort of works.\\n[00:10:44.546 -> 00:11:11.061] Oh, my goodness. Oh, I just... Shell Sage likely knows me a little bit too well. I will just mention something, though, about chatting to language models, which is because they are autoregressive, they've learnt by completing sentences. This might seem surprising, but actually they work better if you type\\n[00:11:11.061 -> 00:11:41.602] grammatically correctly, use correct capitalization, you know, that kind of thing. The reinforcement learning phase we talked about last time does help them to answer correctly, even when you say, who do TMUX? But, you know, it's actually worth spending time. We could, you know, it'd be probably, maybe we should add a little grammar and capitalization fixer or something to solve it at some point, but we don't currently have that. So it is definitely worth spending time\\n[00:11:41.602 -> 00:11:56.553] trying to type things carefully to get better answers. Yes, I totally agree. Luckily, Shell Sage was able to understand me in this instance. So it gives me a little bit of information on what are the main things\\n[00:11:56.553 -> 00:12:19.221] do with tmux as you can see there's this control b which is kind of like entering command mode in tmux and then you have some next sort of key press that will trigger an event for example if i want to create a new window i can do control b c and now i've created a new working space\\n[00:12:19.221 -> 00:12:48.969] session, or window in this case, where I can run commands that is separate from the one that I was just in. So let's try to focus here on the bit that I reckon everybody ought to know, which I reckon you don't need to know this, I would hit Ctrl D to close this one, and to go back to the original one. And then I would show focus on the split panes, because that's what like, I think everybody probably wants to know how to do. And then with Ctrl B, Z, that is going to\\n[00:12:48.969 -> 00:13:11.913] really get people uh optimizing their their team the workflows makes sense yeah so um one of the best things if you want to make all of your non-tech friends think you're a hacker is to split your pain into multiple different session into different uh into different pains so control b will uh with uh with the\\n[00:13:11.913 -> 00:13:41.221] double quotes, we'll do it horizontally. And then with the percent sign, we'll do a vertical split. And then to navigate around, I can use Control-B and then the arrow key. So if I want to go back to the main one, I can Control-B up. And now I am in the top one. And all of these are separate, so they don't conflict with each other or anything like that. So can you show Control-B-Z in that one so that I can maximize that pane?\\n[00:13:41.221 -> 00:14:11.369] Yeah, so Control-P-Z basically zooms into a particular pane to make it full screen. And now this is super useful if you've done a lot of outputs and you want to zoom into a particular one to focus on doing some specific task. And then if you want to go back to the multi-pane view, you just do Control-B-Z again, and you're back into the multi-pane example here.\\n[00:14:11.369 -> 00:14:36.974] So the only other ones I would show you perhaps before we jump into Shell Sage would be Control-B-D and Tmux-A because Control-B-D is very nice because it means that you can reboot your computer, go away, come back tomorrow and come back to exactly where you left it, including Jupyter server running, long running training jobs, et cetera.\\n[00:14:38.621 -> 00:15:07.881] Yeah, so if any of y'all have suffered from SSHing into a server, running something, and then your SSH connection drops or something like that, and you realize that your long-running training job was killed because of it, TMUX is something that you should definitely look into because of this ability to detach and have sessions always going on. So if I do this Control-B-D, I have detached\\n[00:15:07.881 -> 00:15:34.653] from the tmux session. And now I'm back into my original terminal shell environment before I launched the tmux command. So you can see all of the history is still here and even the commands that I ran. And if I do something like tmux ls, you can see the existing sessions that are currently available in the tmux server.\\n[00:15:34.653 -> 00:15:58.537] So I have this session 0 that has one window. And if I want to reattach back to it, I would just type in tmux a. And that gets me back into whatever state that I was running in. Any long running commands that I was running here would still be going on without interruption, which is super useful. And a quick question from the chat about\\n[00:15:58.537 -> 00:16:27.342] Authenticating. So you do need an API key from anthropic for this, we will be adding other LM providers as well. But for now, you need to set the anthropic API key environment variable, which if it's not currently mentioned in the Readme, we will make sure it's added to it. Yes. All right, let's use it. Awesome. Okay, so I have a problem with my server. Shall we\\n[00:16:28.137 -> 00:17:10.069] Let's do it. Control-B-Z. And so I have a problem with this server. I have unfortunately put in a lot of data, and so my space is getting limited. So I need to get Shell Sage to kind of find out where in my file system I have my largest files so that I can clean them up. So let's go ahead and ask Shell Sage.\\n[00:17:10.069 -> 00:17:39.753] And this is a place that also voice can work pretty well. Yes, something like transcription with WhisperFlow. We can showcase that in a second as well. But here we can see that Shell Sage has recommended using the sudo du command with a dash ah flag. And it's piping it through a bunch of stuff. But it also gives us exclamation points.\\n[00:17:39.753 -> 00:18:09.061] explainer for each one of these. So in this case, it's running it with elevated privileges because it's trying to do it on the root, which you can do. But in this case, it's going to probably take a little bit too long for this demo. So we'll change that in a second. And then it's using this du command. So this stands for disk usage. And it's just formatting it for us a little bit. And then it'll pipe that and sort it by the top\\n[00:18:09.061 -> 00:18:39.101] files and folder usages. So let's go ahead and run this. It actually even gives a quicker result, one for my home directory, which is actually what I want. It even gives me a little warning here that it might take a large time on large systems. Great. Thank you very much, Shell Sage. Okay. It looks like the problem seems to be in my data. Don't tell us. Have it tell us. Okay.\\n[00:18:39.101 -> 00:19:08.169] All right. Let's see. So let me do it with some voice. Great. I ran the commands. Now what? So it sees the output as well as the history of input. That's the really cool thing about Shell Sage. Yeah. So as you can see, analyzing the output, it's able to tell that\\n[00:19:08.169 -> 00:19:34.189] Oh, interesting. It hasn't actually used the output very well. Yeah, and it is able to navigate, investigate specific directories. So it does know that it is in home Ubuntu data. But I would have said my request would have been more specific than yours, I would have said something like, Oh, what do you see in this output, or something like this, I think it's quite useful to try and\\n[00:19:34.189 -> 00:19:56.994] Again, like try and be the human in the driving seat, not just for SolveIt, but also for Shell Sage. I find it works better if I really try to drive towards the answer I'm looking for. Yeah, I agree. Do you think we should give it a little bit more hints or should we? Yeah, why don't you say like, you know, what do you see in these results or something like that?\\n[00:20:17.826 -> 00:20:41.929] Great. OK, now this is way more specific. I like it. It even gives me the numbers. So it's saying that there seems to be a lot of large video files that are taking up the space, along with some image files. And it even recommends some actions. Oh, also repository with a large Miniconda installation that I probably should clean up.\\n[00:20:41.929 -> 00:21:11.765] I can investigate further for this particular directory that seems to be taking up the most space. But let's go ahead and give it a little bit more information on what exactly I want to clean up. Just before you do, I'm going to answer a question from the chat, if that's OK. So Thomas asks, if you type in your pseudo password, will it be passed to the LLM? Now the answer is no, but I want to explain why it's no. Solve it.\\n[00:21:11.765 -> 00:21:42.633] And Shell Sage work exactly the same way, which is that the thing that's passed to the LLM, the information that's passed to the LLM, is the information you see on your screen. So in SolveIt, everything above the current message is sent as you see it, along with context, if you've added that. And here, everything in Tmux is sent. So, Nate, can you just do a control B left square bracket? So control B left square bracket puts you in scroll mode. And then if you press page up a couple of times,\\n[00:21:42.633 -> 00:22:13.609] You use PageUp? Oh, PageUp. You don't have that on your keyboard? There's PageUp on my keyboard. Should be function up, otherwise. Well, how do you survive without PageUp? There you go. OK. So as you can see, Tmux has been keeping track of all the input and output. And so that's exactly what will be sent. So you won't see the pseudo password there. And so if you don't see it there, Claude's not going to see it either.\\n[00:22:13.609 -> 00:22:43.817] Um, okay, so let's give it a little bit more of a challenge and let's say that I want to clean up all of the files that are above, um, 300 megabytes. Okay. I want to clean up all of the files in the data directory that are above 300 megabytes. How do I do that? Look good.\\n[00:22:43.817 -> 00:23:12.629] Great. Awesome. It's interesting to see because my recommendation would be to look at them first. I'd be interested to see if Shell Sage makes that recommendation as well. Because if you've got like, you know, grandma's 95th birthday, do not delete.mp4. You probably want to know that. Yeah, there you go. It is. So. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And also it is moving them. Yeah. Yeah.\\n[00:23:12.629 -> 00:23:42.397] And so I can also do it with RM and what's even greater is that it uses the proper, you should be using dash I so that you have to confirm whether or not you want those files actually deleted. And it breaks down each one of the bits. So I can also list the files here and make sure that this command is actually gonna do what I want it to do. That one looks good.\\n[00:23:42.397 -> 00:24:17.821] And I'm going to go ahead and delete these because I know that these are not grandma's old home video footages, luckily. And I'm going to go ahead and say, or I'll go ahead and confirm with Shell Sage, does this look right to you? Of course, they won't really know if those are videos you want to keep, but maybe at all. That's true. Let's see what it'll say.\\n[00:24:17.821 -> 00:24:48.593] And yeah, asked me to consider the different options. So that's great. Yes, I've considered them. Thank you very much. It really wants me to back them up. Its recommendation to gzip them is actually terrible, which is interesting. So remember, these things are not always great. Gziping a MP4 won't make it any smaller at all. Oh, interesting. Good call out. And as you can see with the dash i flag, I have to confirm. I wonder why.\\n[00:24:48.593 -> 00:25:06.181] I feel like yeah I think piping into uh rm minus i might not work okay again we've got some minor issues but anyway I think that's enough probably to get started right yeah is there anything else you wanted to talk about shell sage before we\\n[00:25:06.181 -> 00:25:35.145] Move on. Just check out the repo if you have any cool ideas. Also chat about it in the Discord. I've been loving the energy and stuff like that that people have been sharing their experiences and feature requests and stuff like that. I know everyone wants to be able to use other models, so that is a top priority to get in. And feel free to also contribute as well. PRs are welcome. And probably the kind of\\n[00:25:35.145 -> 00:26:02.185] amount of energy required to get started contributing to ShellSAGE would be way lower than almost any other project you've come across because Nate's designed it in a really clever way. So it's very concise, so it's very easy to work with and understand and it's also early days so it's very small. Also at Answer.ai we tend to value lower complexity more importantly than we value, you know,\\n[00:26:02.185 -> 00:26:31.061] A lot of the kind of enterprise style software development so it's like much easier to read and work with so yeah anybody who's interested in like contributing to open source, for the first time. This is probably a good opportunity to do so, and you can do it, you know you can use solve it or notebooks or collab or you know stuff like that to try and do it in a more. solve it friendly way practice what you've been learning.\\n[00:26:31.061 -> 00:27:00.493] Yeah, and also Nate's very helpful and patient. So if you're not sure how to do those things, and there's also the community on the Solve-It channel that's on the Solve, sorry, the Shell Sage channel on the Solve-It server. He can help you. Yeah, I guess one other shout out is that there was a change, and so I'll be hosting the office hours after the class today. With Yaku, I think. Okay, thank you, Nate.\\n[00:27:00.493 -> 00:27:31.061] I will leave you to keep an eye on admin stuff that's happening. Thank you for joining us today. Great pleasure. Everyone see you on the discord. Okay. And then Yaku. Hello. I think we're now going to move to another non solvent thing, which is a specific kind of application area of\\n[00:27:31.061 -> 00:27:59.677] the Solve-It style approach, which at Answer AI, we've been using a lot over recent months and it came up with you during an office hours you were running. So maybe, yeah, tell us about, you know, this idea, I guess you helped out somebody with, with something they asked about. But afterwards I kind of said to you, oh, maybe we should focus actually on teaching people how they can learn themselves. Yeah. So what came up during the office hours was that\\n[00:27:59.677 -> 00:28:28.613] one of the students was looking to learn about generators. And he sort of said that he'd read the docs. Hang on, decorators, right? Say again? Decorators, not generators? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what I meant to say. So Freudian slip if that came out wrong. So yes, decorators. And yeah, he was having trouble understanding it.\\n[00:28:28.613 -> 00:28:58.849] And he just asked if we could go through that. And so we did do a little bit of a solvent explanation, but yeah, as Jeremy said, we probably could have done a better demonstration of how to do that yourself. So that's what we're gonna do today. All right, let's do it. All right. So what I wanna\\n[00:28:58.849 -> 00:29:30.269] learn something from Solve It. We're going to assume that we have very limited knowledge today. We're quite new to even Python itself. And we want to learn about decorators. So we're learning something new and quite early. So I'm just going to start off with a prompt.\\n[00:29:30.269 -> 00:29:59.370] So you're a typer as well, Yaku, or do you use voice input sometimes? I've started using the voice input, but currently Alfred and... Here, I'll show you. See, it's conflicting with the Super Whisper. I need to fix that still. So I'm trying to learn about decorators. I've read the docs, but I just don't get it.\\n[00:30:00.290 -> 00:30:29.837] So kind of treating this like it's Jeremy and I have my own personal Jeremy and I can ask him questions. I don't have to just watch the videos anymore. I can now actually ask him questions. So, hey, I'm trying to learn about, I read the docs, but I just don't get it. Can you show me some examples? So I wouldn't start there.\\n[00:30:29.837 -> 00:30:58.229] Let's talk about how best to get the most out of this. Luckily, it's helping you a bit. When you're getting help here, it does help to understand some basic ideas about how best to learn and how best to do education to help solve it, help you. Rather than jumping into examples, you can see here it's asking us some questions.\\n[00:30:58.229 -> 00:31:29.109] I would start out by saying like, I don't know what, what do you mean functions that take other functions and what that, what's that got to do with decorators or something? Because actually we need to start out by understanding. So I would have started out by saying like, hey, what, what's the basic idea? Can you give me an overview? Okay. Or we can change it. No, don't change it. Let's keep going. Let's go. This is great. We can just cancel. And I would answer question two and say, yeah. Okay.\\n[00:31:29.109 -> 00:31:59.938] Yeah I get functions. Okay so again like let's try to be careful about how we type these things because the better we type the better the kind of better the autoregressive mode is going to get in. So let's say you know use capitalization, say yes, add a comma. It makes a really big difference to the responses we're going to get. Okay. Comma I am comfortable with Python functions.\\n[00:31:59.938 -> 00:32:31.125] And that's another good reason to get voice working is it tends to give you better constructed sentences. Yep.\\n[00:32:31.125 -> 00:33:01.093] So let's start by understanding functions as an argument. This is a key part of decorators. OK. Function can be treated like any other object. So you can assign them to variables. Here's a simple example to try. Would you like me to show you a basic example of passing a function as an argument? Would you prefer to try writing yourself?\\n[00:33:01.093 -> 00:33:30.494] Yeah, I would say, I don't know how to do it. Can you show me? Sure. You just say yes then. And you can press command enter to submit or control enter. Okay. Um, so here's a simple example. So we've defined a function, say hello.\\n[00:33:31.637 -> 00:33:59.158] And we've defined something called apply greeting, which takes a function and a name, and then it's going to call that function with the name. So when we have apply greeting, and then we're going to use it by putting in the say hello function and passing it Alice as the name. Okay, so let's try it.\\n[00:33:59.573 -> 00:34:28.857] So let me just explain how that works to people. So it's like it's not very straightforward. Yeah, go ahead and submit it. I like the way you use the copy up to code there. So in the apply greeting function, the way to think of it is that where it says func in def apply greeting func, that func is going to be replaced with whatever you send it. So we're sending it say hello. So instead of saying func, it will be say hello.\\n[00:34:28.857 -> 00:35:04.361] And name will be replaced with Alice. So it's going to actually return the result of calling sayHello Alice. And this is literally what functions do. In fact, math is basically replacing symbols with other symbols according to rules, as is computer science. And so when you kind of do it that way, you can work through it in your head to see exactly what's going on. I guess we should ask what on earth this has got to do with decorators, should we? Sure.\\n[00:35:04.361 -> 00:35:34.338] So decorate is a special way to use this concept. It's a function that takes another function and returns a modified version. So let's build on this example.\\n[00:35:34.338 -> 00:36:03.882] So here's the same idea written as a decorator. So we've got this at greeting decorator function. And then there's another def inside of it. So I haven't seen that before. It's kind of interesting. It's a def inside of a def. So I'll ask about that in a second. And then let's put this at on top of\\n[00:36:04.706 -> 00:36:34.793] get name, which we didn't have a get name before. So it seems like it's a slightly different example. Yeah. So maybe we should start then by looking at the, it's just a shorter way of writing colon. So maybe let's copy the bottom line that it's got the ad greeting decors. Yeah. So if you copy that by going to the far right and clicking on the copy button and then press Apple V and then we should try it.\\n[00:36:34.793 -> 00:37:04.301] Because that's what we do. But we haven't defined this stuff yet. That's true. So prompt. Yes, no worries. So let's click on the previous one to modify it. I can delete it. That's fine. Yeah, OK, you're right. So let's do it a different way. So let's delete the previous one. Get rid of it. OK.\\n[00:37:04.301 -> 00:37:33.410] delete it. And instead we can modify it. So yes, click delete. And this is actually a useful thing to show people how this actually works. It doesn't want to delete. So let's change. So scroll up so that we can see that. Yeah. Click on the copy this to output button here. Yeah. And we'll see what it actually does is it copies in all of the bits, all of the code, which is quite cool. And so if we just delete the ad greeting decorator and the print, then\\n[00:37:33.410 -> 00:38:00.842] Get rid of that get name, get rid of the print, everything except get rid of the get name. There we go. That's what we want. Get name is not defined. Oh, it's get name we wanted, not add greeting decorator that we wanted. Yeah. So we'll copy this. But not with the decorator. There we go. Sorry about that, Jaco. That's all right.\\n[00:38:05.749 -> 00:38:34.554] Oh, so now we should try it. Oh, what the hell? Yeah, we've come out, got this in a bit of a broken state, haven't we? Yeah, oops. Okay, back to this. Nice. Okay, so yeah, now we've got name is Alice, yeah. Okay. And then...\\n[00:38:36.605 -> 00:39:06.261] We actually wanted the get name equals at greeting decorator. Oh, it's a bit annoying because it's giving it the same name as what we started with. So what if you selected it and made the def called underscore get name, you know, and then get name equals get. Yeah, so we want the whole thing. We just want to do it without the decorator to start with.\\n[00:39:06.261 -> 00:39:35.074] Okay, I modified to do it without the decorator. So to do it without the decorator. So you delete that. Yeah. And then you use change get name to underscore get name. And then copy their last line of code, which says get name equals at greeting decorator into your output. And then change that.\\n[00:39:35.074 -> 00:40:05.954] last get name to underscore get name. Yep. Yeah. So it's kind of like, yeah, trying to get this to actually demonstrate it. It went too many steps ahead. Um, so this is where we kind of got to be a bit careful about that. I guess the educational approach of these things, they, they often jumped too many steps ahead. So now you should be able to call get name.\\n[00:40:05.954 -> 00:40:30.458] And we put in a name that we want. So we add Alice. And, okay, so it came back as hello Alice. And our underscore get name returns name. Okay. And then get name returned a function.\\n[00:40:34.018 -> 00:41:03.938] AddGradingDecorator returned a function. Yes. Returned this new function wrapper that we defined that where wrapper takes in name and then is returning this is an f string so it's going to execute inside of it. So personally what I would do at this point if I didn't\\n[00:41:03.938 -> 00:41:09.502] fully understand it was be like, Hey, can you break this down line by line? That's happening.\\n[00:41:45.865 -> 00:42:16.341] Okay. So, I mean, the goal of this isn't to learn about decorators. It's just to kind of walk through the pros and cons of the approach. I think this is useful, right? So we can see, like, in order to learn stuff with SolveIt, we have to be quite intentional. And, you know, you really want to, like, try every example. And anytime there's an example you don't understand, you've got to, like,\\n[00:42:16.341 -> 00:42:46.082] asking, you know, and keep going into smaller and smaller pieces. And if it tries to go too far ahead, you've got to try to rewind and kind of go through it more, you know, more slowly. So I think something that would be really useful in the office hours, you know, is if there's ideas, you know, libraries, APIs, computer science techniques, anything else that you've had trouble learning, you know, bring them to the office hours or a study group.\\n[00:42:46.082 -> 00:43:16.261] and work through them, you know, and say like, here's me trying to learn about it. Here's me trying to ask the question. And in the office hours, we might try to really focus on, you know, teaching people how to fish rather than doing the fishing for them, if that makes sense. There's a question in the chat about like, should you delete portions of the conversation if it goes too far off track?\\n[00:43:16.261 -> 00:43:40.898] I'd say yes, definitely you should, right? If the dialogue's not going in a direction you're happy with, because of the way the language model's trained, it will want to continue to go on in a direction that's not very good. Because in the past, documents it's been trained on, things that tended to go badly, keep going badly. So instead, modify one of its outputs to say what you would wish it had said.\\n[00:43:40.898 -> 00:44:10.217] you know, or just delete everything from the point at which you kind of felt like it wasn't going great and try again. It's really important to understand how these language models are trained in order to get the most out of them. What do you think, Yaku? Um, yep. I think, well, I guess we've kind of shown the concepts here of learning. Did you want to keep going or...? No, no, I'm just, yeah.\\n[00:44:10.217 -> 00:44:40.194] to get your comments or your thoughts on the process basically. So yeah I guess let's see how we go after. So after class today there'll be another office hours and maybe folks can join in and you guys can try this out. Nate will be there too right? Yeah yeah for sure he will be there and yeah we can try that then. Okay super. I've got some more examples of this kind of thing I can show if people are interested. And for these examples I'm going to show a new tool\\n[00:44:40.194 -> 00:45:12.610] which I really like. And the tool I want to show is something in Claude called projects. So projects\\n[00:45:12.610 -> 00:45:40.722] Here's an example. Projects have a few things in them. One is just you can add a system prompt. So when I was kind of experimenting with teaching kids calculus, I just added a system prompt. So that's kind of the most basic starting point. And then you can see, you know,\\n[00:45:43.234 -> 00:46:13.634] doing calculus. And one nice thing in Claude is that it can output artifacts, which are fun. And so we kind of used that to kind of ask for examples. And I was trying to help the kids kind of get a sense for the basic ideas behind calculus. The more interesting part, however,\\n[00:46:13.634 -> 00:46:41.030] is that you can add context. Now Discord, I was creating a Discord helper which would let me right click on something in Discord and choose get message link.\\n[00:46:41.781 -> 00:47:06.581] it would basically create a bookmark of that message that I could look up and jump to later. I had never used Discord API before so I basically grabbed all of the documentation that I thought might be necessary and turned them into markdown files. So let's just have a quick look example of that. Often it's quite difficult to kind of\\n[00:47:06.581 -> 00:47:36.258] scrape documentation. Often it uses JavaScript. It often has like, like Google's ones have some kind of bot detection. I don't know why you'd do that because it's really good to have bots using it. But a really good way to do this is if you right click on docs, choose inspect. And then if you press left arrow until you can see basically the entire area that you want is selected like so. And then you can just say copy out of HTML.\\n[00:47:36.258 -> 00:48:05.346] And then I created this thing called web2md.answer.ai that you can paste that into. And underneath, you can see it's turned into Markdown. And then what I normally do is I then click on gist it. Right, and we now have\\n[00:48:06.197 -> 00:48:34.389] a gist that contains that documentation. We should have given it a markdown name so it would actually appear as markdown. There we go. And then what I do is I then add that to my Claude project. And so you can see there they all are, right? And so with this, and then I added a system prompt,\\n[00:48:34.389 -> 00:49:01.929] say like help me create a Discord app and then I would just kind of ask it basic questions like I would like to create an application in Python for Discord in which I could right click on a message in a server and it would send a link to that message to\\n[00:49:01.929 -> 00:49:32.962] a DM to me so that I could effectively bookmark it for later. Based on the documentation provided, does this sound like something that should be possible using this approach? So don't be too concise. Tell it everything you want. Give it all the information you need. And this is kind of where I started.\\n[00:49:32.962 -> 00:50:04.738] The other thing I forgot to do here, because I started doing this back before this was an issue, is I would go back to this here, and I would say don't use artifacts, because they're not at all useful for Python. Save instructions. Just while we're on this screen, Jeremy, could you show quickly where the just was useful there?\\n[00:50:04.738 -> 00:50:31.826] where the gist was useful. Actually, I guess in this case, what was important was the, well, yeah, I can show you. You could actually just paste it in. So maybe in this case, the gist wasn't necessary. You could just copy. So let's go back to the project, Discord. Yeah, so when you say add knowledge, you can either upload or add text.\\n[00:50:32.501 -> 00:51:01.858] So yeah, you actually want to either save the file locally or paste it. So I guess actually in this case, the gist wasn't so useful. Yeah, thanks for checking. So now that we've modified that to say please don't use the totally pointless artifacts, which it's really overenthusiastic about, it should give us something much more.\\n[00:51:01.858 -> 00:51:27.950] prosaic. So you can see. Where was that? Sorry. Now I've lost where I was doing it.\\n[00:51:28.597 -> 00:51:56.898] Anyway, so I used that to create that Discord thing and also to kind of document it as I went. And a similar idea, Richard created a nice tutorial here for Shell Sage using the same approach, I believe, which is adding the context to a project being the kind of existing documentation that they created.\\n[00:51:56.898 -> 00:52:25.250] And one thing that's really helpful is that in these cases, Richard exported a gist of the Claude project output. Unfortunately, there isn't something built into Claude currently to do that. But my colleague and friend, Hamel, has kindly made one. So you can go to Claude Save and get an extension that will save it in exactly this format, as you see.\\n[00:52:26.466 -> 00:52:57.250] So let me give you some tips for kind of how to create good documentation and other things you can do with this. So one thing I did was I wanted to create documentation about a library I created called Fastlight. And so I tried to make sure I asked very specific questions to be like the kinds of things that I really wanted people to know the answers to. So what does Fastlight add to SQLite Utils?\\n[00:52:57.250 -> 00:53:27.705] you know, okay, show an example of doing this, show an example of doing this. And I'm not really getting it to just write the documentation for me. I'm trying to get it to write the things that I want to kind of add to my documentation. So again, it's like pretty much a dialogue between the human and the computer, even though I'm not in Solve It here. This is one of my favorite ones. Actually, sorry, not this one.\\n[00:53:27.705 -> 00:53:55.970] This one's one of my favorite ones. One of the best books I've read for many years is this book by the guy that created HTMX and some other folks. And it's basically all about how to create web applications from a deep understanding of the fundamentals of how the web works. And I think it's amazing. And I wanted to be able to provide parts of that to both have something that humans can read, but particularly I wanted something much more concise\\n[00:53:55.970 -> 00:54:25.266] that a language model can read. So I think I've got something strange here. So let me just do it here. OK. So I don't have the original dialog I used to create this, which is silly of me. I should have kept it. But I can show you how I made it.\\n[00:54:26.402 -> 00:54:53.154] all of the first chapter of the book into context. And then I basically said like, please summarize this for me. And its first summary was crappy. And I basically kept telling it how to make it better. I'd be like, provide a lot more information, provide a lot more examples, copy things than the original. And I went through about five goes until I got one I liked. I modified it myself, editing a few things I didn't like. I then deleted everything between.\\n[00:54:53.154 -> 00:55:22.146] And so I ended up with me asking a question and it giving it a great answer. And then for chapter two, I then put chapter two plus the chapter one summary in and said, please create a summary of chapter two using the approach you see of the summary in chapter one. Here are some things particularly to look out for. So I summarized the things that got wrong last time. And the second time I only had to do it like twice to get a really good answer. And you can see like for a whole chapter, it's got,\\n[00:55:22.146 -> 00:55:50.749] an extraordinary amount of detail and examples, but it's much more concise than the book, right? So it's a really great reference. So again, I deleted the ones that I didn't like as much. And so I added up with something where the answer was exactly what I would have liked, edited it to make it even better. And then for chapter three, I then did the same thing. And then I again added the extra things that were still not quite getting right. And for chapter three, the first time it was perfect, right? And it's got all these great examples.\\n[00:55:50.749 -> 00:56:20.090] details and then so I just kept adding one chapter at a time and after a couple more goes it then did a bad one again and so this time I actually kept the bad one and I said and I and I left it in the dialogue and said no no no not like that you know look at the earlier chapters to see how to do it right here are the problems and so then chapter five again is great you know it's got all this detail and so I found I can add now this markdown of a chapter\\n[00:56:20.962 -> 00:56:49.410] to a dialogue and immediately the language model fully understands how to use HTML and HTMX really well. Let's try to see how I get the URL on the screen. Not quite sure how to do that. Sorry.\\n[00:56:49.410 -> 00:57:19.138] Just trying to get the URL on the screen as well, but it's a bit tricky. I can see it now. Okay, great. I'm just cutting off the very bottom, but hopefully you don't need the very bottom. So let me show another interesting example of this, which is something quite different, which is there's a lot of stuff out there for creating meeting notes. And to me, a meeting shouldn't happen unless\\n[00:57:19.138 -> 00:57:50.685] it's going to create some really useful output. So for me, we don't have meetings at Answer AI very often at all. And when we do, we have a really high bar for what they're proposed to do. And then so since they're meant to be really good, really useful things, then we want the artifacts from that to be really great. So the normal meeting notes you get from AI tend to be super concise and not really tell you what went on. So when I had a meeting with Hamill,\\n[00:57:50.685 -> 00:58:17.890] I pasted the whole thing into a cloud project that I use for this purpose, right? So it's like, here's my Zoom meeting. I just paste it in the full transcript. And I said to it, this is key. I said, right, rewrite this to be suitable for publishing in a magazine, right? Combine their contributions so it's less fragmented, clean it up, right?\\n[00:58:17.890 -> 00:58:46.810] Do not lose any content. This is the most important thing. Just do the first eight paragraphs. And then stop. And so then here's the entire... Oopsie-daisy. Here's the... So I've got a brand new keyboard, which was possibly a mistake to use this because it's a really strange layout. Okay. So here's the whole transcript. And then it's like, okay, here's a rewrite.\\n[00:58:48.194 -> 00:59:17.410] And it always does, you know, a pretty bad job. So I edited it. So I did a couple more versions of that and said, no, no, that wasn't right. That wasn't right. And then I kept, you know, the one that I did like. And then I said, great, go on. Okay. And each time I remind it, right, what I want it to do, you know, or you can just kind of keep the dialogue going. And again, it's like, yes, you know, more reminders about the things I want to make sure it gets better and better at, you know.\\n[00:59:17.410 -> 00:59:44.054] And I just keep going small bits at a time. And it ends up with a super nice shareable artifact that I shared with my team. And people really appreciated it. People were like, wow, that was such an interesting thing to got a lot of information out of this.\\n[00:59:47.117 -> 01:00:15.714] Yeah, so it's probably a bit different, right? I mean, it probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to do rather than like zero minutes. But for sharing something that's meant to be a really high quality artifact from a really important process of like, you know, multiple people are going to be reading or watching this thing, I think it's really worth doing. Another example was I wanted to teach people how to use\\n[01:00:15.714 -> 01:00:46.485] Fast HTML, like what's the purpose of them? So I included all, you know, a lot of the hypermedia book I just showed you, the summary of it in the project. And also the Fast HTML, some of the docs. And so I'm being really very quite focused here on what I'm trying to get out of it. And hoping to kind of think about the kinds of things that people often misunderstand. Like, well, what the hell is actually a hypermedia application?\\n[01:00:46.485 -> 01:01:09.686] So that's another example of trying to do the kind of FAQ based on things I'm actually getting asked on the Discord to get the kind of answers that I want. So I find that useful. I also did the same approach because FastHTML is based on Starlet. I wanted a really good manual for Starlet.\\n[01:01:09.986 -> 01:01:39.170] People understand the architecture of a fast HTML application. Again, I'm just providing it. And the nice thing about this approach is that each time I build these, I can use more and more of them in the context for the language model. And so they just keep getting better and better. And that's kind of what we're looking for, right? If you let the language model drive a process,\\n[01:01:39.170 -> 01:02:04.322] they're generally going to get worse and worse because of kind of the limitations of these kind of autoregressive approaches. But when you're doing this kind of approach, each dialogue you create is better than the last one. Each prompt response was better than the last one, you know? So again here, like what are the components of fast HTML? How do they work together? And\\n[01:02:09.314 -> 01:02:38.466] you know, again, I'm kind of showing examples that I want them to show me how to do it. And so I tend to kind of, sometimes I provide these gists directly as links from the docs. Sometimes I'll go in and edit the gist, right? And so then this is really important because then when I use this as an input context for another Claude project, right? I can tell Claude like, oh, look out for the notes from me where I've pointed out\\n[01:02:38.466 -> 01:03:04.134] places that previously a model misunderstood it. Here's another one. And it's also for humans, you know, humans, humans that read these things and computers are going to be pretty similar. So Jeremy, if you wanted to summarize another book, would you maybe, and it was like web related, would you then maybe start by taking a section of your HTMX thing that you've done or the whole thing and\\n[01:03:04.354 -> 01:03:34.018] putting that in first? Yeah, if I'm looking for something similar where it's kind of quite a technical book with examples, I would probably say like I'm looking to convert this chapter and include all the examples just like I did with this chapter with those examples. Absolutely. So as you know, Yaku, and I assume this is why you're asking this question, this is called in context learning in AI. And it basically means giving examples of desired outputs for inputs. Language models work dramatically better, like way, way better when it's in context learning.\\n[01:03:34.018 -> 01:04:06.821] The problem is most people don't know how to do that because it's not particularly clear what the examples should be. If I had examples, I wouldn't be asking the question. So here we're building up a library of examples. And again, the kind of the idea here is we're trying to get in this really positive reinforcement loop where every time we use AI, we get better at it and the model gets better at it, exactly.\\n[01:04:06.821 -> 01:13:52.738] Great. Okay. So maybe we'll have a five minute break before we jump into Advent of Code. And when I come back, I will also check the chat to see if anybody has any questions. Sound good, Jaakko? Sounds good to me. Okay. Thank you, sir.\\n[01:13:52.738 -> 01:14:38.185] All right, I'm back. Are you back, Yaku? I am now, yep. We're all back. I was busy reading the Zoom comments. Excellent. Sorry, the YouTube comments. Actually, I'm not quite organized as it turns out.\\n[01:14:38.185 -> 01:15:07.046] I think I'm organized. All right, are we ready for some Advent of Code? And what are we doing? Day three, right? Day three. Okay, so hopefully you've all\\n[01:15:07.554 -> 01:15:25.398] had a try at this already. So let's remind ourselves as to what we're doing. And I think you're sharing, Jeremy. Okay, I should probably do that then. Oh, and I know the shortcut\\n[01:15:37.890 -> 01:16:05.058] need the URL anymore. Okay. Oh, a question in the chat. Robert's asking how I change the answers of the AI. Well nowadays, now that Solveit exists, I would just do it in Solveit. So back then we had some\\n[01:16:05.058 -> 01:16:34.914] different proof of concept approaches I had to use instead. But nowadays, yeah, SolveItDirectly lets you change the answers of the AI. So that's what I would do. All right. The gondola lift isn't working. Engine part's missing. You have to add up all the part numbers. Should be easy to work out which part's missing.\\n[01:16:34.914 -> 01:17:05.410] There's a visual representation of the engine, lots of numbers and symbols. Any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a part number. So we're getting our notation. Okay, so there's a part number. Periods are not symbols. Okay. Great.\\n[01:17:05.410 -> 01:17:34.722] copy that, and we've got a new feature called duplicate, thanks to Jono. So to do, to use that I've now created a little advent of code template, which actually I guess I could also add a little bit of help to here by saying input equals get data\\n[01:17:34.722 -> 01:18:00.745] actually before I do that we should run all, so I get some help for autocomplete. Get data, okay, year equals 2023, and day equals three. Great. And\\n[01:18:00.745 -> 01:18:30.025] really matter what the day is because we're going to be just using this as a template. So then I'm just going to go duplicate. Then I'll click on it. And edit the title here to AOC Day 3. Maybe worth leaving the day empty in your template so you don't accidentally forget to change it.\\n[01:18:30.025 -> 01:19:00.297] I've been caught with that once or twice with you using the wrong days input. That's a really good idea. Okay. AOC day three, part one. Okay. Okay. Import. Column 50 say.\\n[01:19:00.297 -> 01:19:29.182] Okay, so that's our sample. C code. Okay. Okay, sample.\\n[01:19:30.609 -> 01:19:58.274] Okay, there we go. Okay. So what I've noticed is often people seem to find the parsing bit the hardest. I think with the solver approach the parsing bit for me is always the easiest. And the trick is just to go into smaller and smaller pieces for the parsing.\\n[01:19:58.274 -> 01:20:26.338] make the smallest bit work and then gradually build back up again. Now in this case, the goal here is we need to find all of the numbers which have a symbol next to them. So I kind of like to think about what an ideal data structure for that would look like. And I guess rather than this current one,\\n[01:20:26.338 -> 01:20:56.610] Now what I really want to know is where are the numbers and where are the symbols? Where are the numbers to know if it's next to a symbol? I need to know where the number starts and where it ends. Now I happen to know how to do that, but let's assume we don't. So we can ask.\\n[01:20:56.610 -> 01:21:26.370] What is a concise and easy way in Python to find all of the places where a string of digits starts and stops inside a larger string? It's not always easy to explain exactly what you want. You'll notice often, as is the case here, I misspoke and re-spoke, and generally these modern voice-to-text things tend to do a perfectly good job of figuring out\\n[01:21:26.370 -> 01:21:56.245] You don't have to worry about it too much. Okay, ari.findita. So something that Nate added recently, which is really nice, is that any time that you in your prompt or note or the assistant in its response has a function in backticks, it provides a hyperlink to it. So a key, key, key thing.\\n[01:21:56.245 -> 01:22:24.102] is any time that something comes up that you didn't previously know about in Shell Sage or Solvert or Claude or whatever, is stop and go learn about it, right? And that's why this has been made as convenient as possible. Okay, so here is find iter. I'm just going to turn my Discord off because it keeps beeping. There we go.\\n[01:22:25.666 -> 01:22:54.626] find iter return an iterator yielding match objects over all non-overlapping matches oh that sounds interesting non-overlapping for re pattern and string now the thing about documentation like this is it's super concise because it uses bits of jargon as a shorthand right which is a perfectly fine thing to do as long as you always look up the jargon and the jargon is generally in good documentation like python is going to be a hyperlink\\n[01:22:54.626 -> 01:23:22.114] An iterator, what the hell is that? An object representing a stream of data. Each time you call next, you get different successive items in the stream. Again, it's a bit of an infinite tree of jargon, but over time you'll learn these ideas, these core ideas, and you'll be able to read them more quickly. What the hell is a match object? A match object.\\n[01:23:22.114 -> 01:23:51.861] OK, well, basically, the key thing to know about an object is what can it do. So you read through it. It's got an expand. It's got a group. A group can take zero or more group IDs. And then the key thing is the examples. So I would read all that. But for now, I guess the key thing we want to know is basically, how does it work?\\n[01:23:51.861 -> 01:24:19.078] and basically how does it work is what's the signature of it. So if you just pop a question mark there, okay, then you find out. Okay, it's find, iter, pattern, string, flags, and a quick summary. Okay. Okay, regular expressions. I know regular expressions, so I am\\n[01:24:23.170 -> 01:24:53.506] Because I know regular expressions. Regular expressions are amazing. They have a very, very unfair reputation as being difficult. And I think the reason for that is that they are a concise notation, you know, like math.\\n[01:24:53.506 -> 01:25:23.605] example. And things with a concise notation cannot be read at all like math by somebody that doesn't know the notation. It just looks mysterious, right? But just like to a Chinese speaker, Chinese is not hard to read, English is. To an English speaker, you know, Chinese is hard to read. An unfamiliar notation will be unfamiliar until you learn it. But that doesn't mean it's hard to\\n[01:25:23.605 -> 01:25:49.954] Regular expressions makes things easier, much easier. And there's a small subset of regular expressions that I will teach you so that you will know enough to be this person. But yeah, don't let it bother you that they look strange.\\n[01:25:53.986 -> 01:26:21.918] Basically, a regular expression is something that allows you to search through a string to find substrings that match a pattern. And so we're going to describe what some of those things are. Let's first of all create a joined version of the sample, just a smaller version. I'm just going to go sample.replace\\n[01:26:25.461 -> 01:26:54.722] And replace a new line with nothing at all. And we'll start playing with it. Okay. So a regular expression takes a pattern. What's a pattern? It's a string. So just to make this a little bit less typing for me, I will go from re import\\n[01:26:54.722 -> 01:27:24.482] findIDA. Okay. So I can now just type findIDA. And the first thing I need is a pattern, right? So here's a really simple pattern. Four. What does four find? Four finds a four. That's actually, let's do a seven just to make it more interesting. Okay, where do I find it in? Inside my string ss. And findIDA\\n[01:27:24.482 -> 01:27:54.242] returns an iterator. So basically you'll get this kind of thing a lot in Python when it says iterator. Basically what that means is that you get something that you could then loop through later to get all the answers from it. To do that all in one go, I can simply do this. Now that's a lot of work.\\n[01:27:54.242 -> 01:28:25.506] So let's not do that. Let's instead say define findItter. And this is basically a way, a totally standard way, you can always wrap a function and get it to do something else. If you say star args star star keyword args, that basically says pass through everything that you get sent off to something else. We just say return list re.findItter.\\n[01:28:25.506 -> 01:28:55.202] Because I want this to work for me, I want it to work the way I want it to work. And I always want to be able to see the list. So modify your environment to make it work the way you want. So now that we've done that, we can get rid of list. Great. Just little things.\\n[01:28:55.202 -> 01:29:23.906] slightly easy, easier to deal with. Okay, so what's it done? Well, it's looked for all the places that the pattern matches in the string. The pattern is 7, so it's told me that it's found it's matched to 7 at 2 comma 3. Okay, now immediately we've seen something that a lot of people on the Discord messed up, which is\\n[01:29:23.906 -> 01:29:51.522] span is the start and the end, but be careful because look, 0, 1, 2, this is 2, that is the start, the end is past the end, right? So be very careful. It starts at 2 and 3 is just past the end. Which is like, it's not bad, right? Because the difference between the two is 1 and this is of length 1, that's fine, right? But just be careful. So you can see that by\\n[01:29:51.522 -> 01:30:19.670] studying our data as we go, it really helps, right? So we found all the sevens. Do you think they do that so you can slice it nicely? Fits with the slice notation? Yeah, exactly. Ranges work this way. Pretty much everything in Python works this way. Yep. I think that's a great point, Jakko. So no complaints about it, but certainly an easy mistake to make. But again, we read the docs and then we tried it.\\n[01:30:20.021 -> 01:30:50.565] then we looked at the answer and so we've got everything we can now, you know. And so being in too much of a hurry with Advent of Code to like win the speed race can be a bit of a mistake because what we actually want you to do is maximize the learning race here, which is another good reason to do the 2023 version because at this point you're not going to get on the leaderboard. Okay, now being able to find the sevens is somewhat useful but not super useful. Let's find the digits.\\n[01:30:50.565 -> 01:31:20.770] So here's where what I would do is I'd press command shift up arrow and that creates a new cell with the same as the last cell. And I'm going to show you the first thing to learn about. I'm just going to show you a really minimal set of things which will get you a really long way. The first thing I want to show you is that you can type in a set of things to look for. And a set is always in square brackets. So I want to find\\n[01:31:20.770 -> 01:31:51.405] anything in that set. All right, so there they all are. So that's found four, six, seven, one, one, four. Okay, I'm gonna close that up. Don't quite need all that on my screen at once. That's enough to know, right? But obviously that's a little bit annoying to type all that.\\n[01:31:51.405 -> 01:32:19.426] So it might be useful to know that you can instead use a hyphen to say everything between 0 and 9. You can also do a to z, and there's the same thing. And now we're at the point where it's like, you don't need to learn, this is called a character class, right? So this is a character class, it's all, everything in this set. For what it's worth,\\n[01:32:19.426 -> 01:32:50.114] some character classes are used enough that people have even shorter shortcuts for them. So identical to this is backslash D. Backslash D means a digit. You never need to use it. You can always use square bracket naught to nine. It's slightly less typing to write backslash D. There is, however, a bit of a problem, which is we need to put an R in front of it, and I'll show you why. If I write print,\\n[01:32:50.114 -> 01:33:15.189] backslash n, for example, as you might know, that's not actually a backslash followed by n. That's actually a newline character. So in Python, to say I actually made a backslash, you can write an r at the front, and that means everything in this string, a backslash means a backslash. It means don't turn them into anything fancy.\\n[01:33:15.189 -> 01:33:45.154] R, you can think of it as R for regular expressions, because this is where you use them all the time. So basically, anytime you're using a regular expression, it's not a bad idea to get into the habit of typing R apostrophe or R double quotes all the time. Okay, great. So we've learned about character classes, and I said that we're going to try to stick to the\\n[01:33:45.154 -> 01:34:15.170] minimal necessary bit. So then the second main thing to know about in, um, regular expressions is that after a character class, which could, this is a character class, this contains number seven, it's a set of possible things. This contains the set of those things. After that, you can then, um, add, uh, a second character to say, how many times do you want that to appear? By default, you want it to appear once. So there's a single four, a single six, a single seven. Okay. Um,\\n[01:34:15.170 -> 01:34:45.937] If I want one or more times, plus. Plus means the previous character plus one or more times, which is actually what we want, right? So if we submit that, then I think we can agree that's looking pretty good. 4, 6, 7, 1, 1, 4, 35. You see? And they're not overlapping. So there's all the places that we want.\\n[01:34:45.937 -> 01:35:14.437] So Dr. Mikko on the chat says he quite likes writing regexes, but finds them hard to read. And they're hard to read in the same way that math is hard to read, which is two possible reasons. One is you don't know some of the symbols. And the second is you try to read it too fast. So the only way to read a regular expression is to go through every single piece bit by bit.\\n[01:35:14.437 -> 01:35:41.626] Now one way that can make that a lot easier is to go to somewhere like regex101.com and paste in your test string without the quotes and\\n[01:35:45.442 -> 01:36:15.362] in your regular expression and say this is a Python regular expression and notice here how it says oh I'm always going to put an R in front of it by default so that's nice and you can see exactly what's going on right zero to nine match the single character present in the list zero through nine okay followed by\\n[01:36:15.362 -> 01:36:39.698] single character, plus matches the previous token, one to infinity times, and then here you can see all the matches. Okay, so this is a a good way to, you know, check your understanding, but also as you can see solve it's also a good way to check your understanding.\\n[01:36:43.061 -> 01:37:14.121] So let's try that then. This is looking pretty good. Let's try it in Samp. Again, this is why you, you know, want to do this stuff carefully. Make sure it all works and like, oh look at that. That worked too. So we don't really need that SS thing. So I'll just delete that.\\n[01:37:14.121 -> 01:37:41.834] Is the ss closer to what the real one is going to look like to me? Oh no, they have the backslash n's in there, don't they? Yeah, they have the backslash n's and we actually care about what line it's on. Yeah, that's right, sorry. So, we actually need to know something. This is not quite the right answer. Like, you could turn this into the right answer, to be honest, because each line is some particular length. So,\\n[01:37:42.338 -> 01:38:11.906] It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's 10 long. So if we did this integer divided by 10, it tells you what row it's on. And if you did this mod 10, it would tell you what column it's on. But why use math when you don't need to? I'm not a huge fan of that idea. So instead,\\n[01:38:11.906 -> 01:38:40.578] we're going to try and do it a bit smarter, a bit simpler. And I'm going to just go back, so I've got a somewhere around a neat little, yeah this, I'm just going to steal this. I'll show you this in a moment because it comes up quite a lot. So I always like to be able to visualize things easily.\\n[01:38:40.578 -> 01:39:10.769] I should probably put this actually in my template because it comes up so much. But here's a command called show. And it's going to go through each row in some matrix. When I say matrix, it's just a list of strings. And it's going to print it out along with some numbers. And I'll just show you what that looks like. So if I say show samp. Oh, what did I do wrong? Ah.\\n[01:39:10.769 -> 01:39:45.173] So first of all, exactly, so before I would do that I would always say lines equals samp dot split lines. And very often I like to run, I've modified something up here, I want to modify, run everything below. So don't forget we have a run below button, so that runs all my messages below. And obviously this then needs to be lines.\\n[01:39:45.173 -> 01:40:15.157] Okay, so I think that's a bit easier, right? Because now I can immediately kind of see the coordinates of everything. And so I can kind of more easily now check whether I'm getting back the coordinates I want. So 4, 6, 7, I want to see something saying, oh, it starts at 0, 0 and ends at 0, 3, just one past the end, or 0, 2, depending on how we do it. Maybe we want 0, 2.\\n[01:40:15.157 -> 01:40:46.050] And then like 35 starts at 2 comma 2 and ends at 2, 3 or 4, so forth. So the row it's on is actually pretty straightforward. That's just going to be the row number as I loop through each one. And the column, we know how to get that for the start and the end, we can get from find . So that feels reasonably straightforward, right? We can\\n[01:40:46.050 -> 01:41:16.706] So when the lines represent a matrix, I often like just to call it m, because there's nothing particularly special about them being lines, right? So perhaps you folks remember from last time, we've seen that you can go for i comma o in enumerate, and that just, oh yeah, and you always need\\n[01:41:16.706 -> 01:41:46.498] parentheses in my list comprehension. Okay. So there's my row numbers. It's kind of quite nice, along with each one. And so then for each one we want findItter. And we want to find the digits. So let's grab that. And we could even say, like, digitsRe is this. Okay.\\n[01:41:46.498 -> 01:42:16.642] And then we'll just go copy and paste. And rather than O, we will say, well, we've got our new special find data, which listifies it for us, which is rather nice. And so first of all, we pass in the pattern. And then we pass the thing to search through.\\n[01:42:16.642 -> 01:42:42.549] So here we go. 0 has two things, 4, 6, 7, and 1, 1, 4. Nice. 1 has nothing. 2 has two things. 4. Yeah, it looks pretty good. 9 has two things. That looks pretty nice, right? So what I like to do now, then, is to think about like, OK, well,\\n[01:42:42.549 -> 01:43:08.522] be the nicest possible way to have this? It's basically like, oh I want a little object which has the row number and the start and stop column, and also what digit it is, right? So something I find really useful for this is to be able to like instantly create any object I want. And there's a nice little thing in Python called\\n[01:43:08.834 -> 01:43:38.946] simple namespace. And I use it so much I tend to give it a different name. I tend to call it NS. And so basically you can create it like this. You just start creating a little object. There's my little object. So I want to create something for parts. They said a part is a string of digits. So as usual,\\n[01:43:38.946 -> 01:44:08.086] I would call it underscore part. And it's going to take two things. It's going to take the y that it's on, which is here, okay, and it's going to take the match object, which I'll call mo. And so we're going to return, okay, and what are we going to return? We need the span\\n[01:44:08.853 -> 01:44:39.305] So let's just come back to that. So let's grab one of these, right? Let's grab, if we grab this, give this a name. Sorry, not that. Yeah, grab this. Which one do we really want? We just want one match object to play with.\\n[01:44:39.305 -> 01:45:11.778] So how about we just grab this and we'll call this matchObjects. And so that way it's going to be easy to play with one, right? So matchObject equals matchObjects zero. MatchObject. Okay, great. So this is where you can just save a bit of time.\\n[01:45:11.778 -> 01:45:39.950] How do I grab the starting point, the ending point, and the matched string converted to an integer for a single match? mo.start, mo.end, and mo.group.\\n[01:45:41.570 -> 01:46:06.401] So return, okay, a namespace containing, so our starting x I'll call x1 equals mo.start, our end2 we'll call mo.end,\\n[01:46:06.401 -> 01:46:34.810] I think I want the start and the end to be semantically the same, so I'm going to subtract one from it because that's actually where it ends. And then we've got the y, of course, which we can just pop here, and then the digit equals int mo.group. Okay, so\\n[01:46:37.410 -> 01:47:04.658] Now that we've done that, of course, we should immediately test it. So underscore part, and we're going to be passing in y. So for the first part that's 0, and the match object is mo. And there we go. How's that looking, Yaku? It's looking pretty good.\\n[01:47:05.058 -> 01:47:33.354] I guess one question I had, Jeremy, it's just with the namespace. Maybe you said that while I was out. Do you just prefer that over like a data class because of more concise writing? Or is there another reason you like that one? Sure. So Yaku's asking about this approach here called a data class, which we could absolutely do, which is where you add a decorator.\\n[01:47:34.245 -> 01:48:00.565] since we've been seeing decorators. And so this is going to be something, it doesn't just take a function and return a function, it can also take a class and return a class. And so we could create a capital P part. And we could say x1 which is an int. And x2 is also an int. Oops, you did the wrong button.\\n[01:48:00.565 -> 01:48:27.878] And y is also an int. And our digit is also an int. And that's totally fine as well. Sorry, what did I do wrong there? Oh, x1 colon int. Don't mind me.\\n[01:48:31.145 -> 01:49:00.450] just don't know Python. Okay, and so then you can do the same kind of thing. Now one nice thing about data classes is that as long as you stick to the same order, you define them, you don't have to say all the equals. So if I go x1, x2, yd, I can say x1, sorry yeah x1, x2, yd.\\n[01:49:00.450 -> 01:49:32.413] That's totally fine too. Yeah, you know, for me, I don't know. This is an extra step. I don't like extra steps. This was less steps because I still need to write underscore part, you know, but I'm fine with either. They're both nice that they print out. One nice thing about data class is it prints out the type of thing or else this one has no type. It's just a namespace. All right.\\n[01:49:32.413 -> 01:50:01.173] So, what we now want to do is we want to get, for every row, we want to get every part. So, I would be inclined then to say, like, I've got some particular row, m, 0, and let's do things in really, really small steps. Okay, so there's my first row.\\n[01:50:01.173 -> 01:50:30.630] There was a question, Jeremy, where you've got underscore part, and then you've got a zero and an MO. They're wondering why zero? Yeah, because this is what we're going to be going through, right? We're going to be going through all the rows. And so on each row, we're going to have the row number and all the matches. So that's where we get our Y from. Yeah. So in this example, we're just looking at the first row, and that's what the zero is. Exactly. So this match here was on the first row.\\n[01:50:31.170 -> 01:51:00.498] index 0, yep. Cool, so we basically could now just grab this, right, put that in a function maybe, so we'll copy and paste. We've already got that re defined, so let's just say def row matches\\n[01:51:01.634 -> 01:51:31.106] Okay, so we're going to be going through the row. And actually, you know, I'm making a mistake here, aren't I, because I'm trying to do it in too many steps, so let's get rid of the def for now and actually do it for real.\\n[01:51:31.106 -> 01:51:59.874] What I'm going to be doing then is that's my, you know, that's my row matches. Oh, and I guess digre was 0 to 9 plus. Oh, so it's actually, we're not looping through anything.\\n[01:51:59.874 -> 01:52:29.154] we're just doing, ah yes, actually what we want to do, oh we don't even need a numerate. Okay, so that's actually pretty straightforward. So it's good that we're doing this in small steps. So we want find iter, that's our row matches, in our row.\\n[01:52:29.154 -> 01:52:58.690] And so now we want to create parts from that. So if we now loop through each one of those. And so we'll call that row parts actually. We loop through each one of those. Okay, so here they all are. Okay. And we're going to want to call underscore part. And remember underscore part.\\n[01:52:58.690 -> 01:53:27.466] the match object and the y. So these are both in the first row, and the match object is going to be something that's coming out of this. Now, so they're the two things, so that's good. So something interesting about this is that we're just calling a function\\n[01:53:29.122 -> 01:53:57.334] on everything in some list. So what I'd be inclined to do then is to change our definition of part. So it's always nice to have the thing that varies come second, and you'll see y in a tick. So we're gonna get lots of matches per y. So let's put the y second. Check that still works.\\n[01:54:02.517 -> 01:54:29.710] does. And what that means we can do is say, come a second, is we can say l findEta\\n[01:54:39.389 -> 01:55:04.002] So create a, oopsie-daisy, create a part. Don't know how that happened. Create a part for every match object, right? Now each of those parts needs to know what the y is, so we can then say y equals zero.\\n[01:55:04.002 -> 01:55:34.818] So either is fine, but I'm just showing you this way to say there's a kind of a way of just getting a bit more into the flow of these things by recognizing that basically you're just list processing, you know, and you can just like, oh, I'm just mapping a function, I'm just mapping a function. Neither is necessarily better or worse. So this is row matches. And it's for, it's quite nice to see, like, what do we need exactly?\\n[01:55:34.818 -> 01:56:05.922] We need a row and we need a y, okay? So, y, comma, row. And so we can just check that works. Row matches, zero, comma, row. Probably a good idea to return it.\\n[01:56:05.922 -> 01:56:35.298] Okay, so this might look familiar, zero row. What's row? Remember, that's our row. And so actually then, we can now do this. Think about this, right? We go L, our matrix, right?\\n[01:56:35.298 -> 01:57:06.328] So that's all of the rows of our matrix. Dot enumerate. So there's all the rows of our matrix with the line number followed by the line. And those are the two things that I want to pass into row matches. Now I've got to be a bit careful here, because probably I want to say dot map.\\n[01:57:06.328 -> 01:57:31.362] But, Jaco, do you see why that's not going to work? Because row matches wants to take two things. Two things, exactly. And it's going to be sent one thing. It's a tuple. Yeah. Yeah. Tuple's just like a list, but we're going to be learning a lot more about tuples in future lessons. It's a very important data structure. So we want to basically destructure that tuple to send the two things separately.\\n[01:57:31.362 -> 01:58:01.026] And there's a thing in the standard library in Python called star map, which does map, but does exactly that. It destructures it. And so L has that as well. So L tries to have all the kinds of useful bits with the standard library in it as well. Okay. So we seem to have found 10 parts here. Or not quite. What have we found? We found not 10 parts.\\n[01:58:01.026 -> 01:58:30.914] Here's a list for the first row. Here's a list for the second row. Here's a list for the third row. So we need to concatenate all those lists together. Yeah. So this is quite often when you do this more functional approach, you often find yourself just clicking on the previous one and adding a little bit to it. And now we seem to have found 10 parts. So I reckon we should\\n[01:58:30.914 -> 01:58:59.713] double check that. Would dot sum work on that last one as well, Jeremy? Yes. No. Kind of. Yes, I think so. Summing lists should work. Oh dear. What are you doing to us, Yaku?\\n[01:58:59.713 -> 01:59:28.994] And the reason that works is quite nice. It's because sum just means apply plus. And in Python, applying plus to lists concatenates them. But that was awful. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nice. We found them.\\n[01:59:28.994 -> 01:59:56.750] So like I said, that wasn't fast, right? But it's not clever. We didn't have to keep anything in our head because we're just doing a little bit at a time. And so now that we've got that, we need the same thing for star.\\n[01:59:58.530 -> 02:00:29.929] And I'm rather inclined then just to say like, well, okay, this is a part. And like, I like to reuse stuff. So why don't we create a star? And that's going to return, now stars are always one long, so that goes to return an x. And it's not an integer anymore. That should always be a star, but let's change as little as possible.\\n[02:00:29.929 -> 02:00:58.698] And then We then called so that's how star okay, and then we called row matches We probably should have called that Let's change it now. You know when you like that's that was a mistake. This is a thing that creates parts Parts\\n[02:01:00.514 -> 02:01:24.510] Because if you kind of later on realize your notation wasn't ideal and you don't change it, then you'll be like, oh no, now everything's all, you know, confused and my brain's messed up, especially if your brain's a bit small and slow like mine is, right? Yeah, parts, that's much better, right? Because now we can say stars.\\n[02:01:35.064 -> 02:02:01.890] Now, a star does not actually mean a literal star in a regular expression. Star is a lot like plus. It's something that says how many of the previous token do you want? But we say no, we actually want a star. So remember, backslash is something that you can add to something that would normally be a special character class and make it not special.\\n[02:02:01.890 -> 02:02:30.710] Actually, we don't just want stars, do we? We actually want, is that right? Yeah, well, there's a sign as well. Okay, so we shouldn't call them stars. We should call them symbols. Yeah. Symbols. And so I think the Advent of Code question defines them not by what they are, but by what they're not, which is actually great.\\n[02:02:32.162 -> 02:02:59.617] already learnt this for a set. And so you might remember in math there's something called the complement of a set. The complement of a set is everything not in that set. So they were defined as being anything that is not a digit and not a full stop. And so let's use our shorthand. Instead of writing square brackets 0 to 9, we're like, oh no, we could just do that. So the complement of a set is caret. So this now means everything not in this set.\\n[02:02:59.617 -> 02:03:28.754] out everything that's not in the set would be too hard, so let's just write it as not the complement of the set, not zero to nine, and not a full stop. Do you need a backslash on the full stop? You do not, because it's inside square brackets. Okay. But, you know, absolutely no harm, so you don't have to know. Full stop is a special character class, meaning anything at all.\\n[02:03:29.442 -> 02:04:00.194] regular expression, which is why Yaku wanted us to be a bit careful of how we dealt with that. Okay, so then we're going to look for all of the sims. That won't quite work yet, because we don't have sim. That's fine, we'll just let it be wrong. We'll go back here, change that to sim, and then run all below. Okay, and not a great row to be testing on.\\n[02:04:00.194 -> 02:04:30.434] So let's do, let's do row 8, because it's got two things on it. Row equals m8, never assume you get anything right, always write it immediately afterwards, otherwise the one time you don't, it'll be broken. Okay, so we found our symbols, right, so like don't spend time thinking, just use what you've done.\\n[02:04:30.434 -> 02:04:59.894] So we don't want parts anymore, we want symbols. And so we've got our symbols, that's good. And so then we just did this, right? So copy, paste, star map, sims. Okay. So now we could say def.\\n[02:05:01.186 -> 02:05:31.906] We want to return two things. Let's do them separately. I guess we'll be a bit lazy about this. It's always good. Copy, paste. So symbols. Okay. And parts.\\n[02:05:31.906 -> 02:06:01.570] I always like to line things up so I can see more clearly I sort of messed something up. And this is the kind of thing that almost no automatic code formatter will use, which will do, which is why I never use an automatic code formatter. I always like to do things as clearly as possible for a human, even if that means typing an extra space myself manually. So then let's return the parts and the symbols.\\n[02:06:01.570 -> 02:06:32.066] And so now we can say, parts comma symbols equals pars our matrix. Check the parts. So, you know, I'm really slow, right? I just check everything as I go. But like, if the thing was originally presented to us like this, we'd probably not find it particularly difficult, right? You'd be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.\\n[02:06:32.066 -> 02:07:04.904] all in the format that we want at this point. All right, so then always nice to just keep reminding yourself what the problem looks like. Cool. So we want to know which parts are adjacent to a symbol.\\n[02:07:04.904 -> 02:07:36.610] So, let's pick a part and a symbol. Look at them. Because our brains are pretty good at dealing with single things, right? Is this symbol adjacent to this part?\\n[02:07:36.610 -> 02:08:08.610] very suspicious about this. I think our symbols are wrong. Are they? Yes, they are. They're always y equals 0. Ah, also here, y equals 0. So I made the mistake. I printed things out as I went, but I didn't bother to read them. Cool. And you can see why, right? y equals 0. So let's fix those two things. So we want parts.\\n[02:08:08.610 -> 02:08:34.358] Y equals row. Y equals Y, rather. Okay, and then symbols. Y equals Y. And then something I like to do a lot is to say clear and run all.\\n[02:08:41.186 -> 02:09:12.833] And that's more like it. Cool. All right. So let's see. y equals 1 is adjacent to y equals 0. So that makes it look like they're next to each other there. This goes from 0 to 2. And this is 3. So yeah, it looks like it is. And yeah, it is. All right. So I could basically say like, right, OK.\\n[02:09:12.833 -> 02:09:42.257] You know, this is the kind of thing I'm always like, well, I don't know. I can type it, I suppose. Or particularly because I can kind of type it in a nice way, right? I basically want to make sure that p.x1, let's think about this. We want to make sure that the symbol x has to be greater than p.x1.\\n[02:09:42.257 -> 02:10:12.149] or equal to, and that one there is minus one because it can be diagonal, right? So it's got to be less than that. And then the symbol.x has to be less than or equal to the parts x2 plus one. And again this is where it's nice that we kind of fixed up those edges as we went, so it's more symmetrical and\\n[02:10:12.149 -> 02:10:42.178] I don't know if you've seen this before, but this is one of these things that might be a bit easier if we did that. This is quite a common pattern in Python. This means that this is between these two numbers. Okay, so we want it to be between those two numbers. And we also\\n[02:10:42.178 -> 02:11:10.965] want the parts y minus 1 to be within the bounds for the y. So like if it's not nice and symmetrical it's always useful to think about y, right. So this one, this one should be true, and it is. Okay, so that's nice. So add a copy and we'll say def\\n[02:11:10.965 -> 02:11:41.250] And then I'd say is, I always like to like use is for my notation for things that are kind of like is something true. So is adjacent. Is this part adjacent to this symbol? And because I use the same things in my parameters, I don't have to worry here about changing anything else. So I won't accidentally have a bug there. So then I'll say is adjacent. I mean, look, obviously this should work. It's the same code, but I still run it just because I'm that anal.\\n[02:11:41.250 -> 02:12:12.450] Okay, cool. So hopefully you can see why this is quite nice, right? Because all I need to do is go through, to know whether it has a symbol next to it, is to go through all the symbols and see if it's adjacent to my part, right? So remember, I've got my symbols.\\n[02:12:12.450 -> 02:12:41.218] There they are. And so I want to go through all of them and see if they're adjacent to my part. Now that's interesting because again, we want the more varying thing to come first. Because it just makes life easier. Because now we can just say, oh yeah, let's go through all the symbols. And for each one,\\n[02:12:41.218 -> 02:13:18.332] going to see if it's adjacent to my part. Let's see, so I've gone through all my symbols. Check if it's adjacent. So my symbol comes in first. Rerun.\\n[02:13:18.332 -> 02:13:45.769] Oh, symbols.map p equals p. My bad. There we go. So yeah, the first one's adjacent. And so we can now say, has adjacency, right? Does, um,\\n[02:13:45.769 -> 02:14:17.001] part have any adjacency has adjacency for my part. And I want to check it has an adjacency if any of these are true, right?\\n[02:14:17.001 -> 02:14:51.253] one does have an adjacency. And so which ones do we want to keep? We want to keep the ones which do have an adjacency. They said sum up all of the… I always forget. Sum up all the part numbers, and a part is something that is next to a symbol.\\n[02:14:51.253 -> 02:15:16.629] let's go through then, and we'll see, let's go through all of our parts. So make sure we know what they look like. So there's all of our parts. Parts. Okay, filter. All of those that have an adjacency. And kind of when you write this out,\\n[02:15:16.629 -> 02:15:47.330] It should sound a lot like English, right? Go through the parts, filter out to find the ones that have an adjacency. Should there be eight of them? I think there was, right? Yeah, there's only two that aren't. Okay, go through all the parts that have an adjacency and sum them up. Okay, getting pretty close.\\n[02:15:47.330 -> 02:16:16.098] wrong there. Oh right, we didn't want to sum up their d attributes. Okay, so to grab all of their d attributes there's a thing in Python's data library called attrGetter which grabs all of something with an attribute. And so in this thing we have something called attrGot. We want to grab all of the d's. Okay, so there's the d from everyone. So go through\\n[02:16:16.098 -> 02:16:45.326] parts, find out the ones with the adjacency, grab their D attributes and sum them up. Okay, getting better. This one here we've called symbols but we didn't actually pass it in, so let's pass it in. That's important. Okay, which means this one we now need to add\\n[02:16:48.977 -> 02:17:18.433] How's that looking, Yaku? 4361. Cool. So I got the right answer. So that's kind of what you want to see. It's like if we have a bug, we don't have to look through 50 lines of code, you know. We just look at one at a time. It also helps in like when we switch to the input.\\n[02:17:18.433 -> 02:17:47.445] if you have a bug, you know, you can kind of do it in much smaller pieces as well. I don't remember, I think we already grabbed the input, right, in our template. Yes, we did, cool. So all we need to do now is basically go through and see what we did. So we went, okay, we did m equals sample dot split lines.\\n[02:17:47.445 -> 02:18:15.646] Copy, paste. Oh yeah, we did parse, didn't we? So then we did parse. Let's find that. Parse. Cool. So copy, paste. And I think that's basically it. Then we did this one here.\\n[02:18:19.205 -> 02:18:46.978] And then that becomes imp. Okay. Submit. All right. 544664. There we go. 544664. So I'm going to wrap it up there. We've got one more part.\\n[02:18:48.002 -> 02:19:16.657] But the reason I want to wrap it up there is the exercise I want you all to go through is to replicate that style, and then part B of the puzzle, can you do it in the same way? And it should be like very small, you know, because you've got basically the parser already,\\n[02:19:16.657 -> 02:19:45.685] the idea of adjacency already. So, you know, have a go at that. Yeah, cool. Any thoughts before we wrap up, Jaakko? No, I think my only thoughts is\\n[02:19:45.685 -> 02:20:15.893] Even myself, I've been programming for quite a while, been adopting the style a little bit more. How's it going? I mean, I imagine it's a bit of rethinking required because you're a very experienced programmer. Yeah, I think there is a bit of rethinking and sometimes it can feel like a bit slower, but it's one of those things. It's like go slow to go fast. And I see...\\n[02:20:15.893 -> 02:20:45.026] some other solutions. The thing I like about it is I'd like to come back to it six months from now, and I think I'd still be able to read all those little functions easily and see all that. And you can run an experiment with them. Yeah, exactly. Which is something that's very often not true of bad code. Also, you might have forgotten how find itter works by then. I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't because you know it, but people were less experienced with it.\\n[02:20:45.026 -> 02:21:09.714] And now it's there, because you could be like, oh, why did the y-ness 1 there? It's like, oh, you can see, oh, it's more consistent this way. Yeah, exactly. So I think that sort of self-documenting nature is very handy. And some things work better with loops and an imperative style, and we'll come across those soon enough. You know, this is just a case of having more tools in your toolkit.\\n[02:21:10.530 -> 02:21:40.130] And you can see also the way we're modifying our tools to work in a way. So a lot of tools in Python 3, they changed from 2 to 3 to make it more focused on speed rather than working well on a REPL. So for things which is nearly always we don't care about speed, you only care about speed in the inner loop of a thing that is slower than you need it to be. So in those cases, fine, you might need to go back and use some of Python 3's\\n[02:21:40.130 -> 02:22:10.153] approaches, but we're modifying things to work the way we want them to in this interactive environment because we want to interact with them constantly. So I think that's something people don't do enough of, I find, is modifying stuff so it works in a way that's convenient. And I think the other thing that's really nice about this approach is it's unlike a Java or something where the thing that you're modifying might be like three classes over\\n[02:22:10.153 -> 02:22:37.429] And so you're constantly having to jump all over the place and you modify something here and that then has a knock-on effect, which on the third file that you weren't really thinking about, now it's like everything here is like in the one context, which I think you can really appreciate. And Yaku, I don't think I've talked to this with you before. So what's your relationship with regular expressions? Are you in the...\\n[02:22:37.429 -> 02:23:05.598] oh, they're useful, we'll reach them, but I have to, but they're such a pain, or are you in the like, oh, I dream about them, or where are you in the regular expression? I definitely don't dream about them too often, but I do like them just because, yeah, like I've used them enough that they're kind of relatively getting easy. So you will have experienced this thing, though, of a lot of folks\\n[02:23:06.626 -> 02:23:30.357] bet some of your colleagues actively avoid them or be like, no, don't use that, too confusing. Yeah. And I think what we often do at work, if it's a particularly, like there are many parts to the regular expression as we'll document, like, okay, like the first part's doing this,\\n[02:23:30.357 -> 02:24:01.026] it's like have a doc string beneath it even for yourself like coming back to it a while later it can just help yeah maybe we'll look at that later at some ways of documenting and splitting up regular expressions there's some neat approaches for that so i think my message for people today is if you're new to them you recognize that um all you need is square brackets plus and star basically you know um\\n[02:24:01.026 -> 02:24:31.717] Even dot, you know, dot means anything. You can create dot with square brackets, but it's easier just to have dot. And that's all you need. We'll learn about parentheses shortly as well, which is a nice little addition. But with, you know, with find iter, square brackets, including the carrot version. So a set, the complement of a set. So they're your character classes or anything at all. Yeah. Followed by star, zero or more.\\n[02:24:31.717 -> 02:24:55.138] plus one or more gets you a really long way and there are other nice things you know as you were saying people can sometimes be a bit worried about like oh it can be slow because you've done a regex or whatever so in in this jupiter type environment something i like to do is use like the at time it um or percent time it um so that it you can very quickly just test like\\n[02:24:55.138 -> 02:25:23.618] okay, if I have this big input, how fast is it gonna be? And you can get your ranges on like what to expect. Yeah, and regular expressions are written in C, right? So actually most regular expressions are gonna be much faster than doing something by hand in Python. If you try to get too tricky, it's possible to construct regular expressions, which are ridiculously slow. And we did see this recently with one of the Advent of Code 2024 things where people were constructing some rather hairy regular expressions\\n[02:25:23.618 -> 02:25:52.450] causing Python to take more than two minutes to solve it and we're saying hey Jeremy solve it's broken. That's like I don't know what the nice way to say is like no man your regular expression's broken but yeah keep them simple and if they take a really long time then yeah try to split it up and simplify it or ask solve it for help. Okay so we've got a few weeks off until\\n[02:25:52.450 -> 02:26:23.042] January the 6th or something like that. So this is a great opportunity to practice what you've been learning. You know, maybe try writing some documentation. Maybe try writing some meeting notes. Maybe try doing some things you didn't think you could do before. Maybe try doing day 25 of previous things. Maybe, you know, like pick something that's maybe, you know, learning something that you didn't feel like you understood. Like, I don't know, dynamic programming or...\\n[02:26:23.042 -> 02:26:50.030] You know, do something that was a bit beyond you, or you've previously found menial, or you've previously been told you're not particularly good at, and try to solve it for you. And try doing stuff in Cursor, in Cloud Projects, in Colab, in whatever, and share, you know, your experiences. Because a lot of people are asking us, hey, how do we use these ideas at work, you know?\\n[02:26:50.402 -> 02:27:18.397] where we use VS Code, or we use Zed, or we use Cursor, or we use Visual Studio, or whatever. And how do I do it in a way that fits well with my colleagues who don't use these styles? How do I work with NBDev to export things? These are all things that we need you to help us with, right? Because we've only got the experience of using this at AnswerAI.\\n[02:27:18.397 -> 02:27:47.709] When I answer AI, we're all using it and we all use NBDev and, you know, we don't necessarily know the answers to these questions. So we would love help, share your experiences, build new tools and have a lot of fun, of course, with Shell Sage. Thanks for joining us today, Yaku. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody. And have a very Merry Christmas to those of you that celebrate it. A very excellent summer for those of us in Australia.\\n[02:27:47.709 -> 02:27:51.619] Winter for those of you in the Northern Hemisphere. Bye. See you.\""
